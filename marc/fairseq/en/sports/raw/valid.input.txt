False Advertisement This did not say #10 or Messi. This was a gift for my son and he is very disappointed. Returning it.
Not comfortable for a husband and wife The mattress topper is not comfortable for a couple, especially if they cuddle at night. The mattress concaved around my wife and I to the point that if either of us was close to the other it felt like we would fall into their hole. It was a lot like sleeping on a sagging air mattress. Maybe this topper is comfortable for those that sleep alone or maybe mine was defective - I have no idea why it is so highly rated on Amazon.
Terrible quality Broke in the first week don't waste your money
Never shipped. Never received product. Very disappointed.
Fit as expected, minus the thigh bands being a ... Fit as expected, minus the thigh bands being a bit too tight. My main concern is how extremely thin they are. They feel cheaply made and am certain they'll snag/run my first wear.
Poor quality My husband said they were comfortable and all, but the second time he wore them the seam was already splitting up the back. And he doesn't have much of a butt, so it wasn't due to added pressure!
Only received one pillow on an order of two? I only got one pillow on the order even tho you pay for two. Also it is way darker than the picture shows. Not real happy about this order. I can’t seem to get ahold of anyone to get my other pillow.
Cheap materials Very cheap plastic. I couldn’t get the drawers to open one at a time they all slid open when trying to open one. I even filled them up with items hoping they would then slide better, but it didn’t work. It is also very noice and squeaks when opening.
Quality and confront. I like the weight of the jacket but after standing in a heavy rain my back was damp.
They were already torn These stockings already had a huge run in them when I opened them up. Otherwise they would have been great.
Does not last Stopped working after a month. Inside battery compartment is rusted out.
That the material is extra thin This what a bad choice for me. The pockets in these chair covers are cheaply made. The material is extra thin as you can see. I placed these on one of the folding chairs & as you can see it ripped due to the material being extra thin. They did however come on time as promised . I wish I would have made another choice. I don’t recommend these chair covers. I will be returning the Un open box of 50 that I wasn’t able to use.
Not what you see Prettier in picture then in person
This can be comfortable in s chair Be careful. This can be comfortable in s chair, but I wanted it for my car. It really jammed my lower back! I had to pull over to get it out from under me. What a waste!
One Star Never received item. Money is gone!
Don't like Ordered for my husband. He hated it. Pillow is way too firm.
Didn't Last Very Long This kind of shredded after a little while. I also didn't like how the metal part kept becoming exposed (because covering kept slipping off) and actually snagging onto my clothing. I will not buy this again as it wasn't very durable.
Socks wrong size - too small!! These socks are high quality but way too small!!
It's Garbage! the fan stop working after almost a month of using it, tried to change the fuse it still doesn't work, my 10 dollar plastic fans are still running overpriced piece of shit!
Not silky at all Bought this in silver and black to try to make my hair softer and smoother. Cheap price too good to be true! Feels like very obvious fake silk. Returned immediately.
It tore early It’s a great idea and felt wonderful but the glove had torn already and I haven’t played more them. Few rounds and daily range practice with it I very disappointed
Item never delivered and poor customer service! Don’t waste your time with this seller! Ordered this item for my infant during this cold weather! Item stated it was delivered but I never received. Customer service was not great about replacing item as that’s what I wanted instead of refund! Not happy with service at all!!!!
Leaked the second night I used it Used this on a sleeper couch with the couch mattress under the blow up mattress and it leaked the second night I used it, wasted my money
Very cheap This broke apart after the first time we used it!
Not scented and Not soap! They are very pretty but they are not scented and are not soap. When wet they turn into a slimy glop. Not at all happy. I should've read the reviews better before purchasing.
O.K. but? Not exactly original equipment. Similar but not the same as the originals. Not that pleased. The photo made it look like the original. They were not at all like the originals.
Beware. Cheaply made. Very disappointed. It is so very thin and see through. Material is cheap and my finger poked right though it. Very disappointed. Won't buy again.
No luck with these, full waste of $$$ Could not get these to work for the life of me. Cleaned and prepped the wall, stuck them on there, pressed fully for a while and then let them sit for a day before adding weight. The darn things didn't even last an hour trying to hold up a normal, light-weight broom. They look nicer than some of the other crummy options out there, hence my own purchase, but I learned my lesson the hard way and emphatically recommend that you look for something else, these don't work and now I just have a bunch of wasted plastic. =(
Unreliable Have never recieved the product. Had zero communication with vendor thats even after I emailed them twice. No way to run a business
Don’t buy this product! It sucks! Did not keep my neck cool
I'm pretty sure it bit the dust Very bright and has a ton of modes, but it didn't last long. I bought in January of 2017 and I use it about 5x a week for several hours a day at work, I even use Nitecore batteries and a Nitecore charger. The power button is not user friendly, and now the light only works on 2 brightness levels, no more turbo mode! I've tried fully charged batteries and even some new cr123 Batts, but nothing is helping. Now it won't even turn on until I've held the button down or clicked it 30+ times. I'm pretty sure it bit the dust.
Don’t waste your money Horrible!! Do not waste your money. They will not stay on.
not the tortilla I expected Just received this in the mail and was struck as to how poor the quality is and how lack luster the workmanship is. There are numerous tucks and wrinkles along the edge and the seam binding/edging just ends - no finishing where it meets itself. The print job is terrible-while it look like a tortilla at a distance, up close it just looks horribly cheap. OK, so I didn't expect it to be super high quality, but I did expect it to be the advertised 60 inches which was the size I needed for a project. Well, it wasn't even that - it came up 2 inches short. Very sad that it feel so terribly short. It would have been perfect if it had been as advertised. I am returning it.
Low suction unit Very low suction, hardly pick anything from the floor.
One Star Product came in with the zipper broken. Emailed seller and NEVER GOT A RESPONSE!!!!
One Star this never showed up
Missing pieces The tie was not with the robe
Where's the rest??? Not sure what happened to my steampunk but this is all I got in the bag
Great Material On The Product, But Plagued With Eye And Mouth Issues I was really looking forward to having a ski mask for cold days. However, this is not what I was looking for. The material between the eyes is so thin that I feel like it's held together by 1 or 2 strands. I'm guessing I would have ripped it immediately had I not been careful putting it on. The mouth is terribly small as well and doesn't feel like it's in the proper position. The only good thing about this mask is the material - It's pretty hefty and seems like it would keep me warm, but I can't outlook the issue with the eyes and mouth. It would be so simple to slightly widen the strip between the eyes, and maybe use less fabric on the sides of the mouth. So far I have yet to find a decent black ski mask on Amazon - pass this one up if you're looking for quality.
One Star Not at all comfortable rides up
No Response. I ordered this in June and was meant to receive it in August. The carriers say they delivered it but I haven’t seen it. Contacted the seller via email and I have received no response. That’s not good customer service. I just sent them another mail. I bought this cos of the excellent reviews I saw here. Not impressed with this one bit.
Does not work Dont believe all the FAKE REVIEWS its a waste of time I tried them all, the only way to stop all the wrinkles and sheets coming out from the sides is by attaching the long straps that go horizontally and vertically from one end to the other end, these corner straps are a joke, you still wake up uncomfortable with wrinkles all over cause the sheets have no pull where its needed and that is in the center.
Arrived broken I love these, but #12 and #13 arrived broken. Didn’t realize and now I’m less than 2 weeks til my wedding and will have to spend more money on new ones. If I could receive new ones of those numbers I would be satisfied with that but I don’t see a way to contact the seller, which is disappointing.
Meh... Materials are cheap and see through. Held together by a light stitch, so easily comes apart. I wish I wouldve saved my money. Bought this for my Florida honeymoon and it just hangs in my closet. Eventually I will send it to the Salvation Army.
Socks run too small and are very tight fitting The socks run extremely small and are so tight that they are difficult to get on. The MED socks (chose based on size chart) are tight on a woman's 7 1/2 shoe size foot and much too small for a man's 9 shoe size foot.
One Star not at all what was advertised
Cheaply made The bras were so cheaply made. Had to return them
1 is not good to use 1 is not good to use.There is no sound insulation.And it's very expensive.It still doesn't work if you try to place a different position.
Junk!! Absolute junk. Do not buy this scope, the internals are complete junk.
Doesn't work This does not do its job what so ever. It does not collect lint or hair.
see thru first of all there no strecth to the leggings and on top of that they are see thru they fit weird and are not comfty i return them dont waste your money on these
Not long at all The shirt is NOT long at all. It does not fit like the advertised photo at all. The color is correct, that’s about it. I’m 5’7, 145 and ordered a large hoping it would be longer.. it is very wide and comes to my belt buckle. If I lift my arms my stomach will show.
It’s a knock off!!! I am soooooooo freaking disappointed in this costume!!! I bought it for my daughters first Halloween size 6-12 months the sizing that’s on the one I received is 6months to 2 years old!!! Like how in the heck is something that’ll fit a 6 month old supposed to fit a 2 year old!! Its huge on my 9 month old!! It’s not at all what is pictured or what others have posted pictures of. It’s like I got sent a knock off!!!! I’m so upset. Halloween is tomorrow if I could I would send it back but she’ll have to wear it since it’s to late to find another option!! DO NOT BUY THIS KNOCK OFF!!!!
waste of money worked 1year at most, then you throw it away
broke fast Worked fine for short uses but fell asleep with the fan on and now it no longer works only the light. Very upsetting, I’ve had it only a few weeks too
Not made well Loved the look of these hand towels but after a few washes the seems are coming out. They are now garage rags. Disappointing!!!
Bought this thinking that it would work based off of ... Bought this thinking that it would work based off of the reviews. Starting clogging up on me. Unfortunately, it's passed the window to return. I should've bought a Bissell.
returns I have called back the same day i received it and got a return shipment and today I am still waiting to pick this up to get my return..
Wrong color Received wrong color
One Star The curtain rod keeps falling as the tension does not keep it place.
Do not order from this company, you will never receive your order Never received my order, took forever to respond to my messages.
Keeps turning off Bought 2 and one does not work turns off then turns off would like a replacement.
Not the right colors I ordered this because of the gold rose BUT when i finally got it oh surprise it looks like an ugly gold color. Extremely disappointed
"Don't look like the picture at all Awful. Not what was described. Don't look like the picture at all. Maybe 4"" tall tops no arms and no wire in the hat or with the Nordic pattern that was in the description."
pretty but can find better I like the color but its so cheep the moment I pulled it out it broke.
A waste of my money. these tools are almost unusable. There are tiny allen head set screws that hold the cutters in the handle they striped out the first time I slightly tightened them. That's not all, every thing in this cute little box are just toys. I'm new to leather work but I've been a master carpenter since 1980. I know how to use tools, but these are really of poor quality. If you want to get into leather working spend a little more and buy better quality, otherwise you might be discouraged by the sad results these tools produce.
Cheap and came with hole There were holes in the seam of the rear end of these leggings and you can’t return them. Wish I realized there was no returns, shame on me for not looking and shame on them for not offering
I didn't like how these fit my daughter I didn't like how these fit my daughter. She simply bend down to pet our dog, and split right in the crotch within an hour of opening them.
I guess I misread the description because I saw that ... I guess I misread the description because I saw that it was 2 baskets. I was shocked when only one arrived. I would never have paid $45 for 1 basket. I chose this because I am disabled and I thought that this basket would make laundry day easier. I can't return it because there is no way I can haul around the huge box it came in. I feel stuck with it and angry that you charge $45 for 1 laundry basket.
Horrible don't buy These are thin and they fall apart would not recommend to anyone
Do not buy missing names and names spelled wrong There was a bunch of top names missing and or spelled wrong
BUYERS BEWARE Awful, awful material. Polyester. Feels TERRIBLE to the touch. Had to throw them away. I would not recommend these to my enemy. I know I have already said awful but I will again just in case you didn't completely get it: they're AWFUL.
Cheap, poor fit It was super baggy in all the wrong places... oddly not too big, just bagged so much that it didn't effectively cover all of the parts that should be covered. I guess you get what you pay for :/
VERY Disappointed. Cheap Materials My son has been loved the product, however we have not owned it for two months yet, and the clip has broken. Very cheap. Very irritated. Amazon should send a new one.
DO NOT BUY THIS FAN!! Blows very mild air at first then eventually stopped working effectively. Money wasted.
The numbers hard to read The numbers were very hard for the kids to read. (It needs to have a different font) I would not buy it again.
One Star It not like the picture in person it looks like a regular tshirt.
Uncomfortable Don’t but. This is very uncomfortable and it was in the garbage can by the end of the day. The fabric had a butch of small perforated holes (it is the style) and the skin would “try to leak out” of it making it super uncomfortable within the hour.
One Star I never received the items
Lights giving out in less than a month I guess I’ll be lucky to get one Christmas out of the tree. I didn’t plan on it being disposed after one use
Fits small Very thin, size small the arms are short.
Super disappointed because I needed for a project They still have yet to arrive. Super disappointed because I needed for a project.
lousy purchase First of all, there are NOT 24 cans - there are only 8. Secondly, the paints do NOT glow in the dark, even after leaving them in the sun for days. Waste of money. Don't bother.
One Star It sheds like crazy... I don’t know about other people. But It is definitely too rough on my skin.
Came damaged It arrived in bad condition! It was bent in many places. Very unhappy
Does not hold air Does not hold air. Have to inflate every use
Received the wrong color I ordered the solid blue and received a blue with gray cuffs and bottom band. I really don’t like the look. It took forever to arrive and is not worth the hassle to return, so it’s going straight to the giveaway bin.
Don’t buy. This shirt is absolutely terrible & does not look at all like the picture. I should have known better.
Color Sending it back. I did not like the quality of the printed birds on it. Looked cheap. So I bought the quilt instead, which was better. Not sure if it's the material that was used for the comforter. Back ground of comforter is also darker than the pictures,
Wrong size This soccer ball was for my eight year old son. However, I received the wrong size. So it’s sitting on the counter unused.
Inaccurate picture If I could give it a zero I would. It’s a piece of thin cotton fabric with a string attached. It is cheap, but still a waste of a few dollars. The picture is NOT the product you get.
Not the best They are super nice but broke as we hung them. Not in one place but all the places
Horrible quality - do not buy This thing was soo cheaply made. Horrible quality. It broke as we were putting the pieces together. I do not recommend buying this product at all. Waste of money.
Return Still no pickup of the item for return
The rails on this product easily detaches. It looks cheap and the spacing between ... The rails on this product easily detaches. It looks cheap and the spacing between the top and bottom racks are too tight making shoes clash.
NOT what is shown!!! As others have stated, What you get is not what you see here in the listing. Instead of a nice little glass vial with a screw on lid you get a cheap plastic piece of crap with a cork stopper. I can see all kinds of problems with this coming open inside the aluminum keychain fob. I bought four hoping to add these to my gifting box but I wouldn't give these to anybody without replacing the plastic vial with something that seals securely. Nice try but epic fail.
Fell apart in my lap as soon as I opened it I ordered this for my sister’s birthday and when I opened the box it fell apart in my lap. I wish I had of read the reviews because this seems to be the normal. I am getting a refund. Cheap stuff that wasn’t even put together. Don’t waste your money!!!
Price dropped a few hours after I purchased this I'm disappointed that just a few hours right after I bought this, Amazon lowered the price 7 dollars. I can't find where I can request a refund for the difference.
Not very comfortabe to sit on My PT Therapist recommened this wobble cushion to sit on. However, I tried it for a couple of hours and got a but ache!
These socks are not fitted for larger sized feet + they shrink when washed I am very unhappy with these socks. They are so small and tight -- and it was very, very difficult to put them on. They felt too tight once they were on -- and they did not stretch out. When I washed them in cold water, they shrank even more. I can't wear these and I would like a refund...please. David Peck
Did Not Heart Did not like the quality. Had a spongy back so that makes it hard to remove.
Color is more green than blue A word of caution on color. This is not blue as shown, but rather a greenish hue with hints of blue. Otherwise it is a nice silk flower. I wanted something more blue vs. more green.
Very disappointed in the delivery of this item I cannot review a product when I have not received it yet. It was supposed to be a hostess gift for Christmas Eve gift to my niece. Very disappointed in the delivery of this item..
Bad Do not buy. It didn’t charge my shark hand vac.
Don’t waste your time or money. The color wasn’t even close to the picture/description, as well as the size. The sleeves were too long, while the bottom of the fleece reached almost to my belly button. (I’m 5’5”, 125lbs and ordered a size small.) I’m in the process of returning it after paying $10 to ship it back 🙄 in hopes that I will get a refund. It took almost an entire month to arrive, too. Don’t waste your time.
Pretty crap product The hem pulled off after one wear, and the slip is now unwearable. Pretty crap product.
Only had 4 in a pack not 6 and they ... Only had 4 in a pack not 6 and they were impossible to pull apart. Also didn't work well on my narrow, close together knobs of my entertainment center.
Empty package Would have liked to review, however my package was empty. Please refund my account or send another.
Way over filled Horrible quality . So give to this over stuff cheap quality pillow and over priced. The idea of “ one size fits all” is clearly their mentality
Got it yesterday; returning it today I took note of the reviews that said the clock just stopped working, but decided to try it anyway because of its looks. And make no mistake, it is very good looking. Unfortunately it does not work. I even tried replacing the first fresh battery with another fresh battery. It ran for 2 hours and stopped again. I wouldn't be surprised to learn that Howard Miller changed their supplier for their clock movements. The low-cost provider can become very expensive if you have to handle a lot of returns and your brand is damaged.
Junk I was obsessed with this lighter for a week, until it stopped working... piece of junk, STAY AWAY!
Disappointed EXTREMELY disappointed . Ordered and paid for pink and received the wrong color . The package clearly says pink .
DON'T DO IT! 😠😠😠😠😠 Don't trust this seller, I haven't received my order and I order it months ago
Garbage Worse thing ever! Do not buy!
Three times I ordered 16 inch brackets and today for ... Three times I ordered 16 inch brackets and today for the third time I received 20 inch brackets. Packaging is labeled as 16 inch brackets but measure out at 20 inches.
Still waiting on delivery of product. I never received this item. Other items delivered on Oct 19th were placed on door step, in excellent condition. I was hoping the product was just lagging behind. I was hoping to receive the pads before my training exercise scheduled for Nov 3rd. I need to resolve this issue. If I need to reorder the item, I need to know is ASAP. Thank you. Ray Solis.
Good for shade, horrible for rain The umbrella is quite large. 3+ people can easily fit under it. It worked well for shade but rain is another story. It leaks from the top, in ththe center, where the handle meets the fabric of the umbrella. I reached out to the seller but was directed the contact Amazon. Because I am outside of the 30 day window, I am stuck with an umbrella that can only be used for shade. So this was a waste.
doesn't blow cold air, even with ice water Does not work as described. These reviews are false. DO NOT PURCHASE, not even eligible for return. Do not make same mistake I did.
Wasn’t satisfied When I opened my package, it had black marks all over it.
they do not keep there seal they are garbage. They do not keep there seal at all. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY
Not what was advertised. Did not look like the photo. It was open on the back.
One Star This dress is completely sheer.
Don't waste your money or shoes on this product........ This suede dye turned the shoes from navy blue to an inconsistent shiny brown.
I do not recommend this company It says it comes with a charger and it does not. I ordered one the first time and it didn’t come with charger, I emailed this company and they sent another one no charger the band was already on it. I am not happy.
It's okay but not great I disliked it due to the fact of how small and very pigmented the picture looked
cheap deal, cheaply made! 5 shorts came in a package deal! 4 shorts all had thread issues and started unthreading immediately!! It got so frustrating I threw most away (1 is still in good condition, the other 4 kept unthreading)
This was advertised as a kids XL. It was more like a kids M. Way too small.
These are the worst fitting xxl compression socks ever These are the worst fitting xxl compression socks ever. I would have trouble thinking that these would fit someone that used large ones.
Holes! Pillow had a hole within 2 weeks of use. Returned for refund. Big mess, beads everywhere in bed!
Its useless. Bought this to clean up cat hair . It does not do it. The spinning brush has stopped spinning if there is any tiny pressure put on it. I'm not talking about heavy pressure, the least amount of pressure, just putting it on the floor stops the brush. Its useless.
Potentially the worst pants I've ever purchased These pants suck. Extremely cheaply made. One layer of fabric and it's not even very soft, the pockets feel terrible on top of everything. The drawstring fell out after about 2 washes and the pants shrunk as well.
Not as described They do not work as well as described. They don't stick as they should to the phone. They somewhat hover over your screen so it slows your ability to type as your finger cannot touch the screen like it should.
Good for a short period of time Good for a short period of time. Now they want to change modes or cycle through modes when the lens is pulled out to make a spot beam. When barely touching the switch it will also change modes. Wish they worked the way they are supposed to, because I really like the size and convenience, fits in watch pocket on jeans, very handy.
This is not keeping time, we have replaced the ... This is not keeping time, we have replaced the battery twice, checks the hands and cannot understand why it won't work!!!
Pros: colors and brightness Cons: Pros : colors and brightness Cons : use one time in fountain 2/4 lights water got into light
Didn’t WORK LIKE ADVERTISED Mattress Still slipped off the futon...worthless, really wanted these to work too but DIDNT KEEP MATTRESS IN PLACE :(
One Star Ordered the double hooks and received the single hooks.
Sizing off Bikini itself is great. However, was sent a small top and a medium bottom.
One Star Half the keys didn't work and we're lodged so they didn't even depress.
Didn't look like the picture The color was off and the dress sizes ran really small.
To give people what they ordered It not like the picture very disappointed ☹️
fragrant oil, NOT ESSENTIAL This is a fragrant oil, NOT ESSENTIAL OIL. Wish I read all the label carefully. Don't buy if you're looking for essential oil.
Save your money and buy from a reputable company Do not buy these, spend a little more money and buy QD swivels from reputable companies like Magpul, BCM, Midwest Industries etc. One swivel works fine and the other one is full of problems. The button is mushy and gets stuck in the depressed position. I sprayed some liquid graphite in it and was able to get it to unlatch. However it won't stay in a QD socket at all, the smallest amount of force will cause it to pop out of the socket, which is very dangerous. Had it pop out of the QD socket twice at the range and nearly dropped my rifle both times but luckily caught it. Only buy these if your going to put it on a cheap rifle that you're not afraid to have potentially dropped, which kind of goes against the whole reason of having a sling in the first place. If you are looking for QD swivels for a duty rifle or any gun you'd depend on with your life then look elsewhere, these will fail when you least expect them to. Buy quality and don't waste your money on these.
One Star This is the band I received.
You’re in for a surprise What a surprise, picture shows complete unit on a hanger but guess what no hanger! Just a fabric material with 10 clips attached very disappointing then show it that way in the picture
Doesn’t mix well. I hated it. It didn’t mix well with anything.
Arrived broken due to driver Pretty sure the driver dropped it over my fence and broke it so I never got to use it.
Opened The original package was opened and taped shut. When I went to return the item it said “this item can’t be returned.”
Shitty Cheaply made. Fell apart easily. Feathers began to come off a few months after purchase. Doesnt look that good in person
Great Card! Really fine detail. Bought for my nurse wife. She loved it!
Great color selection... Fitbit band is comfortable and secures easily... nice color selections as well
Four Stars Looks great. Easy to install. Will probably buy again for additional storage needs.
Be careful on the print size It is slightly smaller that advertised. Only an issue because I printed a large collage an some of the images on the outer edge were small. Single images will likely print great as long as there is not anything on the edge of the photo. Best bet is to be very cognizant of the cropping.
O.k. Not as large as I thought.
Very cute! Waist runs small Great looking item! Too cute but waist runs very small!!!!
Perfect bedroom deco. Nice quality- heavier than I expected.
Four Stars will use them on hard seat church pews
Great quality! Fast shipping. Great quality! Fast shipping.
Unassembled The picture shown is of an assembled finished piece. The item is well made and beautifully painted, but comes unassembled; I assume since there are 24 small toys, this is so the toys can be put in the compartments and one taken out each day to complete the display at the end of advent, which is why it comes unassembled. However, the toys are very small and fall over easily, especially when you wind the base to play the music. I also feel they could easily be lost, so I glued the pieces down to make them permanent and will put fun treats; i.e., Hershey kisses, miniature peanut butter cups, etc. in the compartments. The compartments are small, each holding about 2 Hershey kisses, so if you want to put gift cards or larger candies in them, it will not work. Not all fun size candy bars will fit.
Trendy n comfy Super cute and great material. 36ddd bit tight but workable and great for sucking in the tummy
Comfy Soft and comfortable.
High quality Great material and fit. Very durable. They hug your body and feel great. Very stretchy, and material doesn't show moisture.
Four Stars it fits well with the exception it is a bit snug across the shoulders and bust area
Nice but lacks clarity Nice theme for my autumn bathroom. The image is not as vibrant as I imagined, but I'm content.
Good value and durable two point sling Works well, does slide down a little without tension but overall good two point sling.
Triggers metal detectors Nice wallet but it sets off the metal detectors at the airport. I have to put the wallet in my bag.
Good for the price. Decently constructed for a cheap China product. I didn't see any major sewing flaws. Washed in cold water and air dried before first use. Totally useable.
"VERY NICE, WITH SIGNIFICANT ADJUSTMENT Some adjustment is needed in order to get this hanging basket to look like the picture. Actually, a lot of adjustment. Fortunately the stems, which are overly long, do bend if patiently worked with and in time I'll be happier with the ""look"" of this basket than I presently am. A few more blossoms would have been nice, too, but overall this faux-plant definitely looks like a geranium. The colors and the leaf/blossom sizes are excellent. So while it's still a work-in-progress, I'm reasonably pleased with this purchase and actually am enjoying remodeling it."
Good Product I've been pretty happy with this cushion after using it for several months now. The only issue I have with it is that is tends to slip around a bit.
Really cute amp This mini amp is super cute looks just like the picture but it's plastic guys (you know what, whatever it's cute anyway)
Seems like a nice product I tried it on when it arrived and it appears it will fit. I'm hoping it will block the sun, but since it's winter, I can't say for sure. Seems like a nice product though and I'm excited to have it.
True to size Fit to size. Like them a lot
This is what i need!! It’s a mazing as i need. It will be perfect if there is 2 sizes because it will useful for the kids also.
Order a size or two larger than you usually do. This is so adorable. Don't be put off by the thin material yes it's very thin material but you got to consider the price you're paying for it. But honestly it's so cute. When you get it definitely put it on because it looks actually much better on then you'd think. Runs small but I figured that and ordered a size larger for myself.
pretty good bag. I was not dissapointed , big enough for my cloth for a week. I had it for carry on in the plane. The zippers were good, almost going to easy. I also think the bag looks nice.
Comfortable and stretchy I was looking for a pair of workout type shorts to walk the dogs and lounge around the house. I bought these and even though they are technically sleep shorts, they work just fine. I am 22 weeks and I can wear these throughout the whole pregnancy and even post- baby. They are a thin cotton material but not see through. Would recommend if you are looking for a comfy pair of shorts to wear during and even post pregnancy!
The material is soft and hangs beautifully, Put them in dryer with a damp towel and the wrinkles came right out. These are very nice and well made, for the price they are an excellent value!
Cute and functional Surprisingly good dress for the price. I bought it to use for a costume and it fit pretty well. Armpits are a bit tight, I ended up cutting off the cap sleeves for comfort.
Nice EDC tool but needs a couple mods. The retraction feature was annoying because you couldn't apply any pressure without the blade disappearing. I yanked out the spring with a small screwdriver... just get under there and yank it till it breaks free. I also replaced the blade with harder carbide steel. I use it quite often and it's part of my EDC.
Four Stars They work great! sound great.. I should've paid attention to the sizes.. the tiny one is TINY!!!!!
Good product, but too big This is exactly what I'm looking for. However, when I put these on, there is a lot of space and extra fabric (way too big). My left hand measures at 18 cm and right hand at 19.5 cm so I ordered a size Small according to the table, but they're still too big. Would be great if these were also available in XS.
Works just fine. Mounted easily and no, the screws are not too long I read the reviews and other than folks who were putting the thing on backwards (the holes won't line up!!), the most common complaints are the screws are too soft and that the screws are too long and bind up the bolt. I did not run into either of these problems. I screwed the base down, mounted some rings, and away I went. Works great and was an inexpensive solution. Is it super high end?? No. Is it adequate for what's likely 99% of the users out there? In my opinion, yes.
It has many slots for cards. Its a wallet. I ordered a wallet. It holds my driver's license, other Id.and a few ones. That's what I ordered and it arrived when you said it would.
Compactable and light weight Very compactable and light weight. The stakes are durable and tie out points are well made. Wish it had a few more tie outs on the sides. Mine only came with one on each corner, one in the middle of each side and a center tie out. Used this as a lean-to shelter over my tent. The heat from the fire rolled right into my tent and was very comfortable in 24 degree weather. I pulled, wrenched and stretched this tarp with no issues. Also love that it is very easy to fold back up into its pouch.
Plastic hanger but it works Has worked on 7mm thick hunting waders with 1200 gram winter boots. Kind of expensive for a plastic hanger that could break, but so far so good. Hanger should have been made thicker.
Great product Would definitely recommend. I am super pleased.
The material wasn't what I thought but still nice. Hopefully the smaller size will fit perfectly Somewhat large but reordering in a smaller size. The material wasn't what I thought but still nice. Hopefully the smaller size will fit perfectly.
A streamlined wallet that’s decent for the price Had this wallet for a few weeks now. It’s decent if your carrying only a few bills, no area for change. Keeps your wallet simplistic and quality is decent.
Good quality, good fit, would buy again I like the high waisted leggings I purchased. They fit well, as advertised and are comfortable. Would have liked a little bit heavier material, but very satisfied and would order again.
I like how it has 3 individual dividers in it where ... We keep this out in the living room and just keep a few diapers in it instead of having a whole box laying around. I like how it has 3 individual dividers in it where we keep diapers in one wipes in another and keep the diaper rash cream in the final smaller spot. The handle makes it easy to carry around to other rooms as well just depends where my daughter decides to lay down and have her diaper changed. It's very well made and the stitching seems to be phenomenal. It's definitely worth having
It is what it is. Perfect for the mending job.
Four Stars I wish the shirt was a little more form fitting.
Runs small, but is a nice shirt Shirt runs small. I ordered the XL and I am newly a comfortable XL. It does not fit like the picture, order a size up if that is what you'd like. It is also pretty sheer, and too small at the chest to button. I plan to lose at least 10 more lbs so I will not return as I got it on a deal of the day and don't want to pay more for it.
So warm! I like these socks for the most part. They are very thick and tall, perfect for winter. I was specifically looking for non-slip socks and they work well. The third picture is comparing the seam inside the sock with one from gerber. The one on the right is the one from Wiggle Toes. It does feel smooth for the most part, but there are bumps at the ends. My baby doesn’t seem to mind it but you might do a trial run if your child is sensitive to seams. The only thing I don’t like is that they slip off easily and think it’s because they are too big. I purchased the size 1-3 which is supposed to be 6-12 months. My baby is 9 months old and they are still a bit big. I will try to update this review when she grows into them and if they still slip off.
Cleans up the ends of the bars Cleans up the ends of the bars nicely. Stay in place better than the stock friction-fit rubber plugs. Weigh a few grams more though, so not for weight watchers...
Good machine but iOS app is flawed Machine was easy to assemble, and is small enough for easy storage. Moving the machine around is easy due to the lightness of it and the attached wheels. My only complaints are that the seat is a little hard, the accessory holder is not really big enough to hold a lot of remotes or anything else, and the iOS app that is included does not accurately track distance. When I get off the machine I will note the distance, time and calories burned but when I check on the app or website the distance is about 60% of what the machine/app reported during the workout itself.
NICE SUIT Nice suit, except that the bra pads fold up every time you wash the suit. Otherwise, would have gotten five stars.
Disappointed Love the look but the strap broke within 2 weeks
Four Stars Like the jacket because it has so many pockets! The jacket is very comfortable and warm!
Vey nice holster I like this IWB Kydex holster very much. It fits comfortably. The only issue is the belt clip is a little to far from the holster and doesn't secure around the belt that well, which can cause the holster to sometimes come up a little out of the waist band area at times, but overall it works well.
Fit exactly as expected... Our work changed its dress code to more casual and I was looking for more jeans to fill out my wardrobe. As it's in the summer and I live in the South, these were the perfect boyfriend fit. The fit perfect. The wash is dark, but not too blue. They are comfortable and show off just enough of your ankle. I've worn them with flats and with heels.
On time delivery Delivery was fast all 8 seem to well made
Arrived torn. The bag came torn. I’ve had it for 20 mins. That’s how long it took to put together. And of course the last bag I hang is torn.
Thank you! Very cute, nice quality
Cool fashionable cut off jean vest This vest is pretty cool. It's made in China so it has really crazy tags with weird English that makes no sense. But it's pretty cool and made out of stretchy Jean material. So it feels very movable. I got the biggest size because I'm a bigger person and usually wear extra large t-shirts. The vest fits tight I think you could be maybe a tiny bit bigger but it really doesn't matter and it looks great. I like the American flags inside even though it was made in China LOL
Ok price, but not great. Disappointed in size. We have some other of these type of ashtrays and they are taller.
Great markers, but be very careful with the cap on the brush-tip end The markers themselves are quite nice, but the cap on the brush end has a design flaw. Beware that if you don't exercise extreme caution when putting the cap on the brush end you will end up with a mutilated tip that kind of defeats the joy of having the nice pointy brush tip. Other than that all were nice and juicy and none dried out.
So far so good Bought this for my wife. Went on her series 3 42mm just fine. Fits her wrist great. I guess time will tell.
Four Stars Good quality and awesome for stoppage drills
The size is perfect and matches one I purchased for the larger double ... The size is perfect and matches one I purchased for the larger double sink many years ago. Mat was somewhat thinner than the larger sink mat, but is working well.
It is super convenient to not have to take them off/ change ... These glasses are made well, and are durable for motorcycle rides. The only issue I have is that the lenses don't get as dark as I'd prefer. They get as dark as the middle shade in the picture of the sunglasses. I have not seen them get as dark as the top pair of sunglasses in the picture. It is super convenient to not have to take them off/ change to a different pair of shades when it becomes night.
Four Stars My wife was very happy with them.
Fun for little kids Not bad 4yr old son likes it... not very high quality!
Keeps me from chasing balls all over court This rebounder product will keep you from chasing balls. It is made of good quality plastic and comes with extra elastic bands in case one breaks (which has not happened to me). Simply fill the base with water or sand, throw the ball up, and hit it. Good product for the price.
Four Stars i wouldn't say it's comfortable but compared to some of these body shapers it was much better.
GREAT VALUE I have used this new Bluetooth earbud for a few weeks now, and here are my likes and dislikes. . . LIKES: 1) fits well in my ear and doesn't fall out. Set it and forget it. It only has one button, and if it is set correctly I have no trouble accessing the button (to end or answer a call). 2) Battery seems to last a long time... put it this way...I have not had the battery die on me yet after numerous calls during a day. 3) The charging method is clever. . . just plug in the USB base, and the earbud has a magnet that grabs it out of your hand for a perfect connection every time. You can find in it dark easily! 4) The speaker is very clear and un-distorted....I'd say the best I've ever had. 5) It has a seemingly long range... longer than others I've had. DISLIKES: 1) I do not like the voice. Why not use the old AT&T woman's voice? This woman speaks the commands clearly, but I just don't like it. Sounds like an old girlfriend. 2) When you walk too far from your phone, it doesn't warn you. . . it just disconnects. You have to turn it back on to reconnect. 3) If you don't use it for awhile, it will turn itself off. I guess that is a good thing? I just have never turned them off until I'm done for the day. 4) Occasionally, and always when you are trying to connect a call..... it will just not work correctly. The phone may show you are connected, but the device is not connected and NOT working. I guess it could be my phone.....I am just not sure. All in all, these are VERY minor complaints, compared to everything this device does so well. I highly recommend!
Four Stars Fits as expected but there was elastic showing in some areas so I’m curious about the longevity.
no assembly Good metal-sturdy-small, just what I needed!
Good quality I love how this fits and very easy to just wash and wear. The price is great too
Stylish and Warm I really dig the look of this hoodie but the only thing I would change is the back. It falls lower than the front which I don't like as much, but I still wear this quite often and it can easily be over looked. I'm pretty picky though. The thumb holes and the size of the collar are great in cold weather because they act as built in gloves and a scarf which is cozy. I like the style of this hoodie and the brand.
Prompt shipment Item was as described. Shipment was prompt and well-packaged. Good seller.
Impressed I was very skeptical with this purchase and after spending the amount, was nervous I’d regret it. However, I’m impressed so far. I’ve only used it twice but so far so good. I was looking for something that wouldn’t be extremely expensive, would be reliable and small enough to fit in my apartment. I took several pictures to give a good idea for anyone unsure about how it would turn out. Fair warning, the box is pretty heavy when delivered which should be expected. It took about 15-20 minutes to assemble with two of us. It’s perfect if you’re looking for a basic, simple treadmill. Only con I have so far is the incline, which is kind of nonexistent but otherwise I’m very pleased with this purchase and happy with the price.
Color and Thickness good! Snap-on Puff quality poor. Love the color! Love the Thickness! It’s going to be great for the frigid Northern VA winters. The only disappointment I have is the puff comes off too easily. The snap is not constructed very well making the puff fall off at the simplest movement of your head. I purchased the hat for the flexibility of wearing it with or without the puff. Unless this is just a defect in this cap, you really only have the option of wearing the cap without the puff.
Good for any family member Very comfortable perfect to correct the posture you can use hours without any problem my children like. because it gives them a better posture when sitting in front of the desk.
Would so love to give this 5 stars Would so love to give this 5 stars, but the clock does not work. Not done trying to fix it yet. Hate to send it back. It was so well packaged, and otherwise is in perfect condition.
Good product but watch out for delivery It works as expected. It cools my room (250 sq ft) effectively. However, it is very noisy (as expected). The draining location is very low (very close to the ground). It will need some boosting before I can drain it. The assembly is relatively ease. The product works good but the delivery is poor (zero star). When I received this unit, I noticed there was only 1 strap on the unit and it was kind of loose. When I try to move the box, the bottom of the box fell off. When I opened the box, one of the windows slide was broken, I found that small piece on my driveway!! It is very obvious to me the deliver was not up to any standard. The unit seems to be working fine regardless.
super stretchy! love these pants, I will be buying more colors! I am glad I read the reviews because I was sized at a large but ordered a medium and they fit perfectly. I took them out of the bag and they looked very tiny, almost scary tiny that the waist wouldnt even fit over my thighs, but they did and they fit great as they are so stretchy!
Space-saver A nice size bag to pack in luggage for trip to Europe. Will use as carry-on for return trip.
Cute but runs small! This is a really cute romper and I actually saw someone wearing it on vacation. However the one I ordered was too small for me. I also like coverage around my armpit fat and this didn’t cover so I returned.
I would buy these again. This product is very pretty and I love the special clasps that make it easy to install on jewelry. However the magnets tend to come loose and have to be re glued and it is quite heavy so it tends to slip forward on your neck.
Very happy with the purchase These sheets are very soft and are made of good-quality fabric. They fit snugly to the mattress and the pillow cases are long enough to cover the pillows completely. Very happy with the purchase.
Not bad Nice shorts they did come with a tiny tiny hole maybe about a cm big, but its so minor i didn't bother returning them
I really liked these they are really comfortable they did come with ... I really liked these they are really comfortable they did come with a strong chemical smell so please make sure to wash before wearing
Four Stars It fits nice looks great
Four Stars Material not good quality. I have washed two times and it has shrunk.
Sleek and right-sized Attractive small and not thick and love the rfid safety feature
A decent buy The set is cute. My daughter 6 yr old wore it for school and looked so cute. It’s a good deal for all 4 pieces at that price but the quality of the skirt of is very cheap. The skirt is like felt material rather than a better quality. For the price an and being that you get the whole set, purpose was served.
Four Stars be careful with the top front. once it is folded, the dent won't come out
Socks Socks feel great! Good work socks and very comfortable
Love how it looks Love how it looks. I am usually a M and order a L fits loose enough to wear with jeans or skirts.
Otherwise the fabric is sturdy and nice for the price These run small, I'd say at least one size too small. Otherwise the fabric is sturdy and nice for the price.
Bulky adjustment button, works well, easy to install These are pretty great replacements for traditional laces, however, the components are a big large and out dated. The spring button to loosen the laces is pretty bulky. Otherwise they are pretty awesome for the price.
Nice weights rack Pretty simple design and fairly easy to put together. I like how it gets the weights up off the floor- only wish is that it would hold a couple more sets.
Fit very nice Used it for a Christmas dinner as a maternity dress it complemented me very well fit as expected I prop could of went a size down. Overall happy with the purchase
Comfortable Like the fit of these. They are cut lower under your belly so they can still fit as you get bigger.
Four Stars Works great, and is good looking. My son complains that it rubs on the back of his neck though.
Good quality for the cost. Nice quality and fit as expected.
Great for on the go use Easy to use and carry. I would like a buffer openings for ice
Very stiff Might have to wash a few times
Good but not great Decent pastel pencils for the price. Not super soft but I did not expect they would be. The only disappointment is that the beige pencil must have a hunk of a darker color in the lead. All three of the beige swatches I did have a dark streak in them. So the beige won't be useful. Too bad since it would have been nice on darker papers.
A decent slip I bought/wear this only as a slip, it is very see through other wise. Its been great for the slip function, but it is certainly no spanx either. I hate feeling squeezed in with spanx so it makes me happy, just don't expect spanx control from this product. I like the smoothness of the material, but it does grab fabrics. If it gives me too much trouble, I rub it with a dryer sheet and it helps counter the cling (and smells great, ha!). That said I do have a pet peeve for clothes I have to make adjustments to wear (ie rubbing down with a dryer sheet), so its not as grab and go I as would like it to be.
Nice little dresser We needed a small dresser for a shared bedroom in a camper and this was perfect. Fit perfectly into the space that we needed and looks nice as well. It's not the highest quality piece, but it's sturdy enough for what we need it for and the drawers offer enough room for my daughters items.
Four Stars Does not track blood pressure
Almost a match made in heaven I Really like it, but it’s not quite a love story; it’s very powerful, for something so small, and lightweight. However, the combination of how/where the hose exits the canister, and the size and number of wheels on the bottom, lead to a continual nuisance of tipping over. The plastic lever for switching out attachments is very cheap plastic, and broke as I was unpacking the vacuum. This may be a huge issue for some, but I don’t ever use attachments, so for me, no harm, no foul. The location of the power switch is a bit problematic as well, considering the other switch located in the mirror position on the back of the canister, causes the cord to retract. I’ve done this no less than 500 times. And no, for clarity, I am not a slow learner. That said, I do in fact, love that the vacuum has a retractable cord. I realize it is trivial, but for me, the winding and wrapping of a loose cord is just irritating. Not difficult, irritating. So the fact I don’t have to wind and wrap and wind and wrap, I’ll give it a star back, for the convenience it provides. Overall though, the pros far outweigh the cons.
Quick service had a little mix up with how many was sent but return went ok. Bought 3 items 2 for Christmas gift, my wife loves hers.
Works great for shaving soap I got tired of my favorite shaving soap being out of stock and decided to make my own. I originally tried the clear soap like this from the same manufacturer and added my own raw shea butter, but it came out to waxy. The amount of shea butter in this is perfect. I add in tea tree oil and melt it in the microwave in my shave soap container. Works as well as the name brand stuff I use to buy, but at a fraction of the price. Just make sure you have a good badger hair brush to use with this. If you don't have a shaving soap container, you can use a small tupperware container with a lid. I use a Proraso shaving soap container from a previous purchase. It's all plastic and works great.
LOVE THESE! Arrived on time and in perfect condition! Very PRETTY!
"Comfortable and adjustable I hurt my calf doing double unders during a workout. I think I may have had a tiny little tear. I bought this brace and wear it every day, regardless of the workout. Two weeks later I am able to do double unders with no pain. I am going to continue to wear this for a few more weeks and then always on days that require jumping. It is flexible, comfortable and adjustable. I have big old fat calf muscles...so I am always worried about things fitting. The only reason I didnt give it 5 stars is I was hoping it would be ""firmer"" or...more compression."
Quality Product My husband and I like the blanket. It is a quality product. We have the full size blanket. I am waking up feeling more rested. I wear an activity tracker and have noticed my restful sleep time has increased since I started using it.
Umbrella colour one-sided Beautiful. Would have given 5 stars if umbrella can be seen on both sides.
Good quality product but missing ribbons I am mostly satisfied. It was easy to assemble and the material is sturdy. I was initially disappointed because the package did not include the promised ribbons and adhesive for the ribbons. However, the seller reached out to me. She was willing to ship the ribbons to me, but I had already come up with a different idea. So she gave me a 25% refund. I would suggest this specific product over others due to its sturdiness and ease of assembly. But my advice is to order 2-3 weeks in advance so that if you need the ribbons and they're missing, you can tell the seller and have enough time for them to get shipped to you.
Very bright, beautiful piece of decor Used this in my entryway above the coat rail and over a bench. My boyfriend loves that print so I added it to our home. The narrowness of the print made it perfect for the space.
Great basket! The basket fits well in the bottom of my closet and holds the extras that seem to float around. the only reaso I didn’t give it 5 stars is I wished it was a little bigger.
Snug fit. Nice under clothing-cannot tell I like that I got a medium and I can make is smaller. I am 5’4 142 and if one wants it tight, you can...and if you want it with a little more breathing room, it can still be adjusted without the need to go up a size.
Great decorative lantern - perfect for outdoor use! This was perfect for what I needed it for...deco for our back patio. I like that it’s made from a hard plastic but that it looks like metal.
Made wrong but would be great I love the product however I just noticed the one strap will not lay correctly because it was stitched wrong so it is twisted
Good Pants These are good pants for just walking outside or lounging and such. They are not anything special, but they get the job done. The do get a bit more snug after wash/dry.
Quality for a goid price. Fast delivery. A bit snug, purchased for Mom who LOVES THEM. need more designs and colours.
Super Easy! I needed last minute stockings and mantel holders. Both worked out great. Came with a set of 4 different hooks. Sturdy and worth the money!
Decent, Gets the job done Not a fan of the straw. Some times if the straws not open just right it's like your tying to drink peanut butter out of the bottle, but it does keep my drinks ice cold for a long time. Might have to buy a different lid
Product as described! Rating based on the following - product as described and quick shipping. At the time of rating this product, I have not used it so I’m unable to verify how well it works for my needs. It looks better than a previous product purchased from a different seller that didn’t hold up after 3 uses. Hoping this product will be much better :)
Great jacket Great jacket you can use it for casual and riding a bike. Very good product on the material. Order one size more so you a have a more comfortable fit.
Cute image of a dabbing unicorn! Although the one I received had a manufacture defect of an upside down image, it is cute and I have contacted the seller about it to resolve the problem. The canvas tote is well made and has leather strapping as handles.
Adorable shorts!! The shorts are super adorable and comfortable if you size up. Originally purchased an XL, my normal size, they were way too tight. Returned for a XXL and they fit perfectly. They don’t look exactly like the product picture but they’re still cute.
Four Stars Plastic piece and works as described. You get what you pay for.
Super duper comfy! I love these socks to wander around the house in. They are too thick to wear inside shoes comfortable (to me) but they are super soft and they keep soft through many washings. My only worry is they tend to bunch up at the top and I find strings I have to cut off after almost every wash. I'm really afraid one day I'll go to put them on and they'll have lost their shape around the top. Until then, though, they are fantastic!
warm and well made This was a winter in Milwaukee when you needed a hat and neck warmer.
This was an ok product. It got the job ... This was an ok product. It got the job done but was a little bit of a pain to weed out.
If you’re between sizes, SIZE DOWN I’m 5’3”, about 115 lbs and the small fit me a bit big. It wasn’t noticeable visibly so much as comfort, they fit but could be tighter over all. So I gave them to my roommate who is 5’5”, about 130 lbs and she loves them! I reordered them in grey because they didn’t have xs in Black. Over all they are cute and comfy and a solid material and I can’t wait to get my grey pair!
I would buy again They do burn for approximately 1 hour. They are a bit drippy but nothing out of the ordinary. The colors are bright. Even number of each color.
Little long, but good quality The quality of material was better than I expected. Fits fine. A little long.
"Nice belt I like it, and am glad I purchased it. The only problem I'm having with it is the comes undone easily. The smallest size they carry is for a 26"" waste, and mine is a little smaller."
Great for hanging up or relaxing on It’s very nice . Good size bright. Just not towel material.
Thanks to a second set of strings! 1 string broke! Product came with a second set so after replacing it which took some time was great! Good for kids! So affordable and nice size! Tuner is nice. Turns green when in tune! This product would have got 5 stars had the 1st string not broken!
Sport bands Love the colors & works well with my versa!
Slim laundry basket My kids all have their own laundry hampers. My daughters broke and so I got this one, I like that it is slim and fits in a small place. It's not huge but I didn't want huge because that means I let the laundry build longer. Great hamper!
Only thing I do not enjoy is how annoying to alarm tones are Came quick, is just as pictured and my daughter loves it. Only thing I do not enjoy is how annoying to alarm tones are. There are several to chose from but they are all very abrasive 90s ringtone-esque. My daughter likes them so I guess thats all that matters.
Was just ok Comfortable shirt. Just a bit snugger than I would have liked. Size up.
Runs small This sports bra runs very small I normally wear a small for running or medium if just doing weights. Based on the reviews I ordered a large and it does fit very well without any bulging. It didn’t move around I didn’t think anything was going to fall out. But I wish it gave me a more support like a regular bra does. I’m a 34B, 5’ 6” and 132 pounds. Overall I like the bra. The quality was pretty good for the price. Not flimsy and should hold up. I love the strappy look in the back! I’m giving it four stars only because I wished it gave me a better shape in the front. I will still be ordering more of these.
Handy that it has the two zippered pockets. Works well, having the two zippers is handy when you want to carry a phone and not have all your money/cards go flying when having to remove the phone for use. My daughter uses this one mostly as I preferred one with a bigger pocket but it's more her style and more like a belt than a fanny pack which at 19 years old is apparently a big deal!!
Good basic fitness watch I really like this fitness watch. I like that it tracks my steps, heart rate, and sleep. My only issues that I’ve ran into have been that I hit something once that started a timer and for an hour it ran while I tried to figure out how to turn it off. I still don’t know how it came on and how it eventually turned off. The charger is a little bit of a pain. Other than that I really like the watch itself. It also is at a great price!
"Four Stars Way too long. I'm 5'5"" and need it taken up 3 inches"
Good warm winter jacket. It’s a good quality jacket for the price. It keeps you very warm (you’ll sweat if you are indoors) It’s firmly stitched - and the stitches won’t loosen or come off. So it looks quite durable. The overall look of the jacket is surprisingly quite good. The size is just right. The only thing I’d say is that it’s a little puffy - only slightly. It’s not thin - but is very light.
Good product Works good in protecting the phone but had to cut the plastic off in order to make phone calls. It interfered will the sound.
great for the price Bought this last minute for a funeral (thank you Prime!) it arrived that morning and fit perfectly. Got several complements, great for the price. Arrived pretty wrinkled but came right out
Don’t size up This was super cute. I only wish I hadn’t sized up. I read some reviews that said it ran small so I got a bigger size. I would have been fine with my normal size. Either way I wore it and my little boy thought it was funny.
Great shorts, great price..Tiny Pockets As others stated - FRONT POCKETS ARE TINY. My phone will fall out while standing up, let alone sitting down. Other than that... these shorts are great, exactly what I wanted. Big, thick and comfy at a great price
Four Stars This product does what it's supposed to do. Mine could have been a little smaller.
With no experience to draw from and only going from ... With no experience to draw from and only going from recommendations from others as to the weight of the BB's, I purchased this brand based on the number of positive reviews and the price/quantity. So far no issues...
