threadId=10000	segmentId=10000	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Not comfortable for a husband and wife. The mattress topper is not comfortable for a couple, especially if they cuddle at night. The mattress concaved around my wife and I to the point that if either of us was close to the other it felt like we would fall into their hole. It was a lot like sleeping on a sagging air mattress. Maybe this topper is comfortable for those that sleep alone or maybe mine was defective - I have no idea why it is so highly rated on Amazon. !#nexlpEOL#!

threadId=10003	segmentId=10003	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Cheap materials. Very cheap plastic. I couldn’t get the drawers to open one at a time they all slid open when trying to open one. I even filled them up with items hoping they would then slide better, but it didn’t work. It is also very noice and squeaks when opening. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10004	segmentId=10004	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Does not last. Stopped working after a month. Inside battery compartment is rusted out. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10005	segmentId=10005	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Soft but not durable. These unfortunately fell apart after one wash in cold water and low heat dryer. They’re very soft, and mostly wrinkle resistant, but not durable at all! !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10006	segmentId=10006	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!They are too heavy. I did not like them they are too heavy they are too noisy !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10007	segmentId=10007	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Ehh. This product takes forever to get the wrinkles out of your clothes and you have to keep filling it up with water. It's really annoying to have to keep running to the sink to refill it. It is a more ideal for removing wrinkles for maybe like one clothing item. I like to remove the wrinkles out of my clothes after doing laundry and I usually have a couple clothing items and I cannot efficiently get it done with this product. !#nexlpEOL#!

threadId=10011	segmentId=10011	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Four Stars. Looks great. Easy to install. Will probably buy again for additional storage needs. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10012	segmentId=10012	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Be careful on the print size. It is slightly smaller that advertised. Only an issue because I printed a large collage an some of the images on the outer edge were small. Single images will likely print great as long as there is not anything on the edge of the photo. Best bet is to be very cognizant of the cropping. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10013	segmentId=10013	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!O.k.. Not as large as I thought. !#nexlpEOL#!

threadId=10015	segmentId=10015	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!All the space. Great for space saving. I bought these to store our extra comforter bed sets and blankets and I’ve used 2 large bags and one medium and I’ve been able to fit 2 comforter sets and sheet and most of our blankets in them. !#nexlpEOL#!

threadId=10023	segmentId=10023	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Looks convenient but unfortunately is not. It comes with two cords but only one of each head. I only have Apple products so I could only really use one cord at a time and then the lightening head for Apple products stopped working in less than a month so I returned the product. Also it doesn’t work well if your case has a cover over the charging portal and the cord disconnects really easily. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10024	segmentId=10024	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!I bought this to be able to put. I received an email from the company concerning this product. It said if I put any credit cards in the pockets they will possibly be ruined. I received this email after I bought this product. Please take my advise and don’t buy this product. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10025	segmentId=10025	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Disappointed. Less than 2 months and the car adapter no longer works. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10026	segmentId=10026	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Cheaply made. It wasn’t exactly like the picture and a a stone came off same day I received it but it was a beautiful case so I have already ordered 3 total all at once won’t purchase again though because of that low quality product !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10027	segmentId=10027	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Two Stars. Not for a truck driver !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10028	segmentId=10028	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Battery short and time not always correct and won't turn on. I bought this for my daughter and wish I could return it. I would not buy again nor recommend. Yes, it works but battery life is short and every time after charging it there is an issue, the time is wrong or it won't turn back on. Too frustrating for my daughter and for me. Sometimes it goes to military time and no idea why. By something better. Also its hard band to put on. My child cant do it on her own and she is 9. I would skip purchase. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10029	segmentId=10029	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Looks good but fixed ring. Cool looking tpu case with a sturdy ring but my wife's main complaint was that the ring doesn't rotate 360 so it's in a rather uncomfortable fixed position and therefore she never used it. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10030	segmentId=10030	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Not as nice as I expected, but works fine.. Not as rigid or enveloping as I thought, but I suppose it does its job. Sometimes comes off a bit in my pocket. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10031	segmentId=10031	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Fits properly. I am very pleased with this phone case. It’s really pretty too. The only small complaint I have is that pushing the volume and power buttons is a little tricky but can be done, I also think that once the case softens up in those areas it will become easier. I would definitely buy another case like this one. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10032	segmentId=10032	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Gorgeous case but it is a bit heavy... Absolutely looooove this case!!! Fits iPhone XS Max perfectly!!! It is a bit heavy due to the backside being all glass. I’m also extremely careful to not drop or bang the case as I’m assuming it would shatter because of the glass backing. Brought this case solely for looks & it truly is very very gorgeous! I get compliments daily & I’ve had this case for a month or so now. I would not recommend this case if you’re looking for solid protection from dropping or banging your phone. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10033	segmentId=10033	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Convenient!!. Love this case! Only gave 4 stars because black was the only color option. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10034	segmentId=10034	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!great screen protector. purchased this because all of the tempered glass protectors kept cracking all the time even without dropping my phone. this screen protector feels like vinyl and even though I didn't watch the installation video, iI was able to install without a problem. Due to the liquid application, I found you can respray and start over if you made a mistake. The only thing I had to get used to is my finger didn't slide easily when swiping or playing games but it seems to have gotten better. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10035	segmentId=10035	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Don't let the size fool you!. This speaker is very impressive!! It may be small but it puts out very loud and clear sound! The volume on my phone was all the way up so when I started playing the music it scared me because it was so loud. I was immediately impressed with how loud and clear this mini speaker is. Everyone needs to have one of these! !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10036	segmentId=10036	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Light weight, fast charge!. I love this charger. I purchased one for myself, then one for my husband, the two more for my daughters. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10037	segmentId=10037	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!So convenient and a low price. I came to depend on wireless chargers from when I had an iPhone 8. Unfortunately, my charger was not compatible with my new phone (11 model). This one from Anker is a different company, but it works just as well. The charging is quick and it works with the phone's leather style case. I wasn't sure if I would get another wireless charger but a couple of weeks plugging and unplugging quickly changed my mind. And for the relatively low price, this one is a great deal. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10038	segmentId=10038	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Hopefully it last .... Hard to properly lay it and squeeze out the air bubbles at the same time ... hopefully it stays in tack if not there’s two more in the pack that I can use I guess !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10039	segmentId=10039	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Great headphones. I was skeptical at first but these headphones are pretty good for the price. When I put these headphones in they block out all of the outside noise. Sound quality in my opinion is great. The only complaint I have is the part of the headphones that wrap around your ears are pretty flimsy. But other than that these are really good, and I would definitely recommend these before you decide to spend over a $100 for some beats !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10040	segmentId=10040	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Innacurate. Product is innacurate. Temperature off by several degrees. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10041	segmentId=10041	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Worthless. Didn't work. Food not crisped at all - even though I tried multiple times raising both temperature and cook time. !#nexlpEOL#!

You are guaranteed to get scolded when attempting to pour a cup of tea. The so called heat glove gives a false sense of security to the first time users which is why I felt obligated to stress how dangerous this teapot is! Do Not Buy This junk! !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10044	segmentId=10044	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!VERY DISAPPOINTED. These are nothing like the first bunch I bought. They don't stay lit. They barely smolder for more than 30 seconds. You have to stand right on top of them to get any scent! !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10045	segmentId=10045	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!VERY SMALL!. I know previous reviews said it was smaller than the discription but I thought id try anyways. There really isn't any other options out there for the xl Power Air Fryer. This is VERY small!! I havent even used it yet bc I cant seem to find use for something so small. (Im referring to the pans.) Now its too late to return it. Unless you have a small Air Fryer... DO NOT ATTEMPT to buy this anyways! I should have followed my gut, with the other reviews. Shame on me! The cup cakes might be fine and the metal racks might be okay... but I mainly wanted the pans to work. Guess Ill be giving this away to someone who has NO FAMILY OF 5. :( I gave this 3 stars bc it doesnt seem HORRIBLE just FALSE dementions were described from the seller. !#nexlpEOL#!

I took a few out and proceeded but it jammed again. The few that did cut properly was okay. Went back to using my garlic press. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10047	segmentId=10047	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Not pleased. It was not durable. Hard to fit stuff in. !#nexlpEOL#!

threadId=10049	segmentId=10049	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Not a Good Choice for Hot Beverages. This is an attractive, substantial mug. For drinking cold beverages I think it is a very good choice. I drink hot tea from large glass mugs. This mug shattered the second time I poured hot water into it. By contrast, three of the four large glass mugs I purchased at WalMart 5+ years ago are still going strong (one of them broke for other reasons). Thus, I do not recommend it for hot beverages. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10050	segmentId=10050	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Just OK. Difficult to open/close, but good for freezer stuff like fruit. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10051	segmentId=10051	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Durable and cleanable - Careful with the lids. I have lost about 35lbs in the last 6 months.using meal prep. I use about eight of these containers a week. They are durable they clean well and they don't leave a weird taste in food even after 5 or 6 days. I would caution you to be careful about the lids. I have lost two and broken one in the course of regular daily use. These are a good investment; but in a year or two when I need to buy more I'm sure it will be because if a list shortage. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10052	segmentId=10052	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Helps pies look as good as they taste. I’m one of those bakers that can make something taste great but really struggle making it look pretty. I was sick of wonky pies that didn’t look as good as I wanted them to, and spending way too much trying to braid a pie crust only to have it turn out uneven and sloppy looking. For that reason, I LOVE THIS. It is so incredibly easy to use and really helps take your crust to the next level in a matter of seconds. I personally still struggle getting the decorations to stick onto the crust and not just fall off after baking, but that’s user error all the way. Buy this, it’s worth it and saves so much time. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10053	segmentId=10053	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!No backing. Looks, works great, but could use a heavier backing. !#nexlpEOL#!

threadId=10057	segmentId=10057	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Functional and presentable. My guests loved the personalized keychain, it came with the bags which made them very presentable. The keychain is functional being a bottle opener too. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10058	segmentId=10058	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Air tight seal. These lids work great to store any food product. You can stretch it over a bowl of liquid and turn it upside down without spilling a drop! !#nexlpEOL#!

I had pink hair, I was taking the color out with vitamin c tablets and dandruff shampoo but I heard this product would help me take out the color better. HORRIBLE MISTAKE. I left it on for 20 minutes and when I checked it, it was gray/light blue. I have no idea how it could possibly turn this color if I had no type of blue tones in my hair only pink and reds.. I'm devistated by the outcome of my hair. !#nexlpEOL#!

threadId=10102	segmentId=10102	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Not brushed nickel.. Listing says brushed nickel. Box arrived and labeled satin nickel. Waste of time. Simple description and they got it wrong. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10103	segmentId=10103	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!EMPTY SEALED BUBBLE ENVELOPE. I RECEIVED AN EMPTY ENVELOPE- SEALED, BUBBLE ENVELOPE - and this is the SECOND TIME THIS MONTH THAT THIS HAS HAPPENED WITH AMAZON!!! BOTH HAD HUGE BUBBLE WRAP ENVELOPES, both SEALED, and both 100% empty with nothing inside no paper work, no item - NOTHING. I contacted the post masters/carriers in both cases and they claim ZERO fault ; telling me to “take It up with AMAZON” but contacting amazon is Next to bloody impossible!!!! I’m disabled with a brain tumor so I use amazon daily - but after over a decade off patronage now I am beyond panic 🤦🏻‍♀️ !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10104	segmentId=10104	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!It’s a no for me. Beautiful shades but they are drying and do not apply well. Not worth the purchase. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10105	segmentId=10105	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Not what I expected. I only receive one even though the description stated I would receive a 3 pack. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10106	segmentId=10106	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Didn't like at all but I am not going to pay .... Didn't like at all but I am not going to pay to return so will just sit around till I throw it out. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10107	segmentId=10107	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Meh no idea what it does. Don't think it really does anything !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10108	segmentId=10108	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Meh. Little girls underwhelmed by the neutral colors; over time polish got thin and didn’t cover well !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10109	segmentId=10109	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Bad shipment packaging. Came all crumble up didn’t like the way they packaged it !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10110	segmentId=10110	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Great So Far. I liked how easy it was to apply and made a difference right away. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10111	segmentId=10111	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Silky smooth with full coverage!. Seems very difficult to find a full coverage powder that looks and feels smooth and not chalky, but this is an excellent example of both! The color is slightly darker than usual; I am very pale and always use the lightest color of any cosmetic line. Apart from being slightly darker than others, I am very satisfied! !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10112	segmentId=10112	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Not the easiest to use. My best friend wanted to try this. She thought it was going to be amazing. I’m not impressed. I’d rather use wax. 🤷🏻‍♀️ It pulled my skin if it wasn’t super hot. And if it was hot enough to come off easily it burned my skin. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10113	segmentId=10113	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Base color is black, not brown. I like everything about the wig except the color, and that’s my fault for not looking carefully enough. It would look better on a woman of color or an olive complexion or even a younger person. The base color is black rather than brown, which is what I need. Still, the style is cute, very spiky and ther is a lot of hair so that it could be trimmed or thinned if you wanted. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10114	segmentId=10114	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Color is pinky. Not super happy w color. But I still love this brand. !#nexlpEOL#!

threadId=10116	segmentId=10116	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!It really works!. I'm going to first be honest in saying I was VERY skeptical of a glass file having the ability to shine my nails, without damaging them. I am happy to say that I was pleasantly surprised when I first used one. No damage to my nails, and a perfect shine to them! I love that this file is dual purpose, and small enough to fit in my purse, or zippered wallet for quick on the go carrying. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10117	segmentId=10117	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!The texture is wonderful. It worked well for someone like me, with extra sensitive skin. I would recommend it. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10118	segmentId=10118	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Perfectly made and Superior Quality for medical grade disposable waste. Sharps will be safe until they are properly disposed of.. Excellent medical grade equipment and perfect for anyone who needs to lock down there sharps. In a society where we have to deal with worrying about what's going to happen with our disposed of syringes and medications this is absolutely Superior. Was able to lock it down until it was needed to be emptied. At which time I called for someone to dispose of all my stuff and everything was complimented on the quality and craftsmanship of this lockdown box for sharps. Couldn't be happier !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10119	segmentId=10119	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Happy and shiny. Great product. I needed to help dry sun damaged hair. Leaves my hair soft smooth and silky !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10120	segmentId=10120	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Don’t buy! Will not get the product you pay for. Don’t buy! I ordered Mango flavor specifically for flavor and received regular Fruit Punch! Waste of money and false advertisement! !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10121	segmentId=10121	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!They were very comfortable prior to failure. Split three of them within four hours of use. They were very comfortable prior to failure. Too bad, they did not last. Junk !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10122	segmentId=10122	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Security seal. I have just receive this product and while the outer security seal seemed intact, the lid came off easily without breaking the seal and the inner seal was not intact. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10123	segmentId=10123	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Uncomfortable fitting. Too bulky in the middle !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10124	segmentId=10124	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Don't buy.. What a wast of money. They fall apart and are hard to light and when they do burn they don't burn slow. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10125	segmentId=10125	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!NOTHING SPECIAL. OK BUT NOTHING REALLY SPECIAL. NOT IMPRESSED WITH. SEEMS SMALL. AGOOD BANDAID WOULD DO SAME. CAN ONLY BE HONEST , !#nexlpEOL#!

threadId=10127	segmentId=10127	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Nausea and serving size is 3 tablets. These are rated very high, and I love that they are made from whole foods. But they make me very nauseous (I am not pregnant, but taking prenatal vitamins to prepare for pregnancy), and a serving size is 3 tablets at a time. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10128	segmentId=10128	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Only 2 Flushes. I bought this and used it and had only 2 flushes. I don't know what happened. It lost it's potency. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10129	segmentId=10129	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!New Cap Design...Fail. Why change in cap design? Arrived damaged and spilled soap contents seeped from the sealed box and spread to other items in the box. The seal on the original bottle design worked great! This item is not eligible for return with subscribe and save. I am going to cancel my next order and purchase another brand that ships better. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10130	segmentId=10130	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Great feel. Love the suction . Gives you the right sensation you want with adjustment . Nipples enlarge and very sensitive when used .I use them regularly and my nipples are longer and very sensitive constantly. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10131	segmentId=10131	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Good but smelly.. Works good. And doesn't contain anti-freeze, plastics or any other of the dozen or so chemicals found in most off-the-shelf hair goo. Would rather have it fragrance free. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10132	segmentId=10132	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Works well, great length. The massager is pretty simple to use. I like the length, it wraps the body well. I mostly use it in the stomach area for a few minutes, and interestingly after a few days it felt like the ab muscles had worked out, because it felt a bit tight. The massager says to not use it for more than 15 minutes in an area. The cord is pretty long, which is nice. And the remote for it is so simple, it's just a knob to change the intensity of the vibration. I like that you can take the massager out of the velcro wrap/pouch thing. I think the only annoying thing for me is the zipper, when I have the massager ON, due to the vibrations, the zipper starts tapping on the zipper teeth. Overall, I think the massager is pretty useful. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10133	segmentId=10133	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Helps brain fog.. I’m coming down from 17 years of anti seizure meds and the number one side effect is brain fog. These seem to help my brain to connect, when I remember to take them. I’ll probably buy another bottle. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10134	segmentId=10134	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Great value. Great value. I use these to work on engines. They will tear if you catch them on something but otherwise provide good protection. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10135	segmentId=10135	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Well fitting, cute compression socks.. Cute and comfortable compression socks. My calves measure 19.5 inches. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10136	segmentId=10136	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Convenient packaging. Like the round package as fits nicely everywhere and handy in car. More expensive but worth it. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10137	segmentId=10137	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Foams nicely, my mouth and teeth feel clean. I like this toothpaste a lot. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10138	segmentId=10138	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!The baby shower mom got to take it home. The banner I pinned, pom poms were pulled out carefully and ballons came out great! Some of the clear one with stars were okay, some stayed up and the other deflated. Still very cute and great for the price. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10139	segmentId=10139	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Wonderful digestive supplement. Fixed my digestive issues! Now very regular. Great price! !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10140	segmentId=10140	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!This can be comfortable in s chair. Be careful. This can be comfortable in s chair, but I wanted it for my car. It really jammed my lower back! I had to pull over to get it out from under me. What a waste! !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10141	segmentId=10141	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Didn't Last Very Long. This kind of shredded after a little while. I also didn't like how the metal part kept becoming exposed (because covering kept slipping off) and actually snagging onto my clothing. I will not buy this again as it wasn't very durable. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10142	segmentId=10142	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!It tore early. It’s a great idea and felt wonderful but the glove had torn already and I haven’t played more them. Few rounds and daily range practice with it I very disappointed !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10143	segmentId=10143	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Very cheap. This broke apart after the first time we used it! !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10144	segmentId=10144	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!I'm pretty sure it bit the dust. Very bright and has a ton of modes, but it didn't last long. I bought in January of 2017 and I use it about 5x a week for several hours a day at work, I even use Nitecore batteries and a Nitecore charger. The power button is not user friendly, and now the light only works on 2 brightness levels, no more turbo mode! I've tried fully charged batteries and even some new cr123 Batts, but nothing is helping. Now it won't even turn on until I've held the button down or clicked it 30+ times. I'm pretty sure it bit the dust. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10145	segmentId=10145	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Hard to use. Hard to use don't open easily and then hard to put over goat leg !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10146	segmentId=10146	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Maybe a fake?. I am not sure if I received a legitimate product. The diameter of the tube is not the same as the diameter of the scope. It looks cheap when installed on the scope. As far as function, I am sure it would serve the purpose just fine. However on a $1000 scope I want something that both looks and performs well. I contacted Amazon and their service was great with helping me get a refund. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10147	segmentId=10147	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Hope it works better than it looks. Craftsmanship is far worse than the listing picture alludes. It looks like a first attempt at welding by a 7 year old in a poorly lit garage. Sloppily painted with silver to cover what must be rust. I will most likely return the two I bought. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10148	segmentId=10148	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Made of thick paper.. Very poor quality. Thin and small. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10149	segmentId=10149	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Meh. It’s a super weird material, it sticks to your body and is a pain to get off. It makes you sweat a lot but putting it on and taking it off is a pain !#nexlpEOL#!

threadId=10153	segmentId=10153	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!pretty good. bag. I was not dissapointed , big enough for my cloth for a week. I had it for carry on in the plane. The zippers were good, almost going to easy. I also think the bag looks nice. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10154	segmentId=10154	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Nice EDC tool but needs a couple mods.. The retraction feature was annoying because you couldn't apply any pressure without the blade disappearing. I yanked out the spring with a small screwdriver... just get under there and yank it till it breaks free. I also replaced the blade with harder carbide steel. I use it quite often and it's part of my EDC. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10155	segmentId=10155	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Excellent. Kept water with no ice cold for 12 hours !#nexlpEOL#!

threadId=10161	segmentId=10161	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Do not buy !!. Strange products not advertised with jalapeños and nothing good. All chips were packed on top and smashed. !#nexlpEOL#!

threadId=10163	segmentId=10163	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Opposite effect, it makes you constipated. Not good at all. Only worked the first week i only drink it 2x a day. After 1 week it started to give me constipation. I wanted a refund. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10164	segmentId=10164	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!One Star. I have not received it thus far. !#nexlpEOL#!

threadId=10166	segmentId=10166	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Not packaged correctly for shipping. The box was not inside a Amazon box, and was damaged. The waters were all scratched up. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10167	segmentId=10167	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Over priced. Not worth the money tastes no different than any other flour !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10168	segmentId=10168	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Price needs to decrease!. I loved the taste, didn't like that if I had wanted to reorder it was on a two week wait, even as a prime member. I also didnt like the huge price increase! This price has almost doubled since we first purchased it! We wont be reordering, and we're disappointed because we love this stuff! !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10169	segmentId=10169	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Save your Money. Sugarfree and tastless. If you want a chocolatey taste these candies are not it! !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10170	segmentId=10170	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Ok. While I completely love this product! They sent me one that was 8 months out of date. Usually I do not care about this as silly as that sounds. But we don't for things package such as these are. This you could tell was older.. tasted funny, looks funny, and upset my tummy.. so that's not good.. i really wish Amazon would check the dates on the food more.. anyways.. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10171	segmentId=10171	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Convenient and quality is fine.. Fine for lunches. Son enjoys them !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10172	segmentId=10172	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Mostly as expected. The product did not ship with a cool pack, but arrived in good shape anyway. I counted the candy and was disappointed to find that one bag of peanut M&M's was missing and substituted with an extra bag of Skittles. I never intended to eat the Skittles, so it looks like my coworkers will be getting an extra bag of candy. All in all, I thought it would be cheaper than buying the candy bars individually, but after giving away the Skittles, it actually isn't much of a savings, so I won't be buying this package again. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10173	segmentId=10173	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Spicy!. The flavor is delicious! It is a lil SPICY. and there is no directions in english on how to make but the picture directions is pretty obvious. I wouldn't buy this one again but I would buy black bean noodles fresh!!! !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10174	segmentId=10174	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Not as bad as others said. I read others reviews before posting and decided to take my chances. I was pleasantly surprised! The candies were misshapen and had to get out of the wrappers, but since they’re just for me, I don’t care. They’re not stale and chewy; they seem to be fresh minus the obvious one time melt they must have gone through. You get about a ziplock sandwich bag size full of jolly ranchers. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10175	segmentId=10175	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Essential pantry products. Master chefs creating products that last and must be stocked in any real pantry !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10176	segmentId=10176	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Very fine sugar!. I like the fineness of the grains of sugar. I will probably never buy any other brand. Plus, it’s really easy to purchase on Amazon. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10177	segmentId=10177	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Awesome!. I am very happy with this purchase. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10178	segmentId=10178	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Yummy!. I bought these chocolates for the tin. Lol. The chocolates are yummy! !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10179	segmentId=10179	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Yummy and peanut free!!!. One of my fave things about KIND bars is the reduced sugar. I love this one because it’s one of the few chocolate flavored bars that doesn’t have peanuts in the ingredients. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10180	segmentId=10180	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!1 is not good to use. 1 is not good to use.There is no sound insulation.And it's very expensive.It still doesn't work if you try to place a different position. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10181	segmentId=10181	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Horrible quality - do not buy. This thing was soo cheaply made. Horrible quality. It broke as we were putting the pieces together. I do not recommend buying this product at all. Waste of money. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10182	segmentId=10182	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!One Star. Half the keys didn't work and we're lodged so they didn't even depress. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10183	segmentId=10183	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Great tuner, But.... Fantastic small tuner with adjustable frequency option. Only a two star rating because it displays a flashing "A" In the sharp position for the b-string, that problem began two weeks after the delivery. !#nexlpEOL#!

threadId=10185	segmentId=10185	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Not worth it. Jewels fall off alot. Had jewels off when arriving. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10186	segmentId=10186	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!If your buying this for music class at school, Don’t!. My son needed a ukulele for music class, this ukulele is more of a play toy. The strings are plastic and one string immediately broke after opening it. We returned this and had to buy the more expensive one.. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10187	segmentId=10187	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Hard to hold. The idea is good, gives a softer sound than plastic pick which can be harsh on a ukulele... but I find the felt is difficult to grip and slides out of my fingers while playing.. still prefer my thumb best but oh the blisters after a rockin’ out a few tunes! !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10188	segmentId=10188	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Doesnt really work.. Left ear is way lower in volume than the right ear. Cant really do much with the unbalance. They look nice but looks dont help function. :-/ !#nexlpEOL#!

threadId=10193	segmentId=10193	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!GREAT VALUE. I have used this new Bluetooth earbud for a few weeks now, and here are my likes and dislikes. . . LIKES: 1) fits well in my ear and doesn't fall out. Set it and forget it. It only has one button, and if it is set correctly I have no trouble accessing the button (to end or answer a call). 2) Battery seems to last a long time... put it this way...I have not had the battery die on me yet after numerous calls during a day. 3) The charging method is clever. . . just plug in the USB base, and the earbud has a magnet that grabs it out of your hand for a perfect connection every time. You can find in it dark easily! 4) The speaker is very clear and un-distorted....I'd say the best I've ever had. 5) It has a seemingly long range... longer than others I've had. DISLIKES: 1) I do not like the voice. Why not use the old AT&T woman's voice? This woman speaks the commands clearly, but I just don't like it. Sounds like an old girlfriend. 2) When you walk too far from your phone, it doesn't warn you. . . it just disconnects. You have to turn it back on to reconnect. 3) If you don't use it for awhile, it will turn itself off. I guess that is a good thing? I just have never turned them off until I'm done for the day. 4) Occasionally, and always when you are trying to connect a call..... it will just not work correctly. The phone may show you are connected, but the device is not connected and NOT working. I guess it could be my phone.....I am just not sure. All in all, these are VERY minor complaints, compared to everything this device does so well. I highly recommend! !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10194	segmentId=10194	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Thanks to a second set of strings!. 1 string broke! Product came with a second set so after replacing it which took some time was great! Good for kids! So affordable and nice size! Tuner is nice. Turns green when in tune! This product would have got 5 stars had the 1st string not broken! !#nexlpEOL#!

threadId=10196	segmentId=10196	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Great device.. Not a fan of the headphones, but interface is solid. Very low noise and software to adjust settings is simple enough. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10197	segmentId=10197	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Great value, perfect stand for my laptop.... This tripod worked out perfect for my 15-inch laptop. I didn’t have any place for the mouse pad or power supply thou. I found another seller that has selves that clamp onto the OD of the tripod, problem solved! The tripod is sturdy and isn’t expensive either. I’d recommend it to anyone. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10198	segmentId=10198	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!nice set of strings. nice set of strings. Didn't fit like I expected a short scale set to fit but I didn't measure them before I cut them to fit without excess. still a good buy. !#nexlpEOL#!
