threadId=10000	segmentId=10000	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!This can be comfortable in s chair. Be careful. This can be comfortable in s chair, but I wanted it for my car. It really jammed my lower back! I had to pull over to get it out from under me. What a waste! !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10001	segmentId=10001	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Didn't Last Very Long. This kind of shredded after a little while. I also didn't like how the metal part kept becoming exposed (because covering kept slipping off) and actually snagging onto my clothing. I will not buy this again as it wasn't very durable. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10002	segmentId=10002	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!It tore early. It’s a great idea and felt wonderful but the glove had torn already and I haven’t played more them. Few rounds and daily range practice with it I very disappointed !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10003	segmentId=10003	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Very cheap. This broke apart after the first time we used it! !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10004	segmentId=10004	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!I'm pretty sure it bit the dust. Very bright and has a ton of modes, but it didn't last long. I bought in January of 2017 and I use it about 5x a week for several hours a day at work, I even use Nitecore batteries and a Nitecore charger. The power button is not user friendly, and now the light only works on 2 brightness levels, no more turbo mode! I've tried fully charged batteries and even some new cr123 Batts, but nothing is helping. Now it won't even turn on until I've held the button down or clicked it 30+ times. I'm pretty sure it bit the dust. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10005	segmentId=10005	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Socks run too small and are very tight fitting. The socks run extremely small and are so tight that they are difficult to get on. The MED socks (chose based on size chart) are tight on a woman's 7 1/2 shoe size foot and much too small for a man's 9 shoe size foot. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10006	segmentId=10006	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Junk!!. Absolute junk. Do not buy this scope, the internals are complete junk. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10007	segmentId=10007	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Wrong color. Received wrong color !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10008	segmentId=10008	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Not the right colors. I ordered this because of the gold rose BUT when i finally got it oh surprise it looks like an ugly gold color. Extremely disappointed !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10009	segmentId=10009	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Do not buy missing names and names spelled wrong. There was a bunch of top names missing and or spelled wrong !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10010	segmentId=10010	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Hard to use. Hard to use don't open easily and then hard to put over goat leg !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10011	segmentId=10011	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Maybe a fake?. I am not sure if I received a legitimate product. The diameter of the tube is not the same as the diameter of the scope. It looks cheap when installed on the scope. As far as function, I am sure it would serve the purpose just fine. However on a $1000 scope I want something that both looks and performs well. I contacted Amazon and their service was great with helping me get a refund. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10012	segmentId=10012	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Hope it works better than it looks. Craftsmanship is far worse than the listing picture alludes. It looks like a first attempt at welding by a 7 year old in a poorly lit garage. Sloppily painted with silver to cover what must be rust. I will most likely return the two I bought. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10013	segmentId=10013	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Made of thick paper.. Very poor quality. Thin and small. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10014	segmentId=10014	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Meh. It’s a super weird material, it sticks to your body and is a pain to get off. It makes you sweat a lot but putting it on and taking it off is a pain !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10015	segmentId=10015	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Came in ripped at the seems. Did not send .... Came in ripped at the seems. Did not send back to avoid extra fees associated in the terms and conditions included in the package. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10016	segmentId=10016	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Not so great for us. I purchased this for my son-in-law in January. First mistake! We should have known better to not purchase something that wouldn't be used for several months. He used it for the first time last week and said it was terrible. It was basically no help at all; it was better and faster to do the work manually. I would have loved to return the item but the time frame for a return understandably expired in February. Him and his dad clean a lot of fish, so admittedly they are probably really good at doing it manually. If you are very bad at it, this device could be an improvement for you. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10017	segmentId=10017	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Two Stars. Nice, but not as pictured. Silver buckle, not gold!! !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10018	segmentId=10018	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Very Disappointed - NOT LEO DUTY QUALITY. Bought as an under belt for duty gun belt. It has one finished (or cut, trimmed) end. And one chopped off, unfinished , sharp cut and not rounded off end. The underside of my gun belt has the soft side of the Velcro, so I needed this belt to have an entire side of the hard side of the Velcro and it does not. The only full length side is the soft side of the Velcro. More than likely, I’m going to take this strap of leather, to a TAC store, and have hard side Velcro sewn onto it, and have it “finished” by them, or just return it and go buy a belt in person from the 5.11 Store. Very disappointed, since I have to qualify on the Range tomorrow, and don’t have any keepers to secure the belts together. Will use zip ties tomorrow, and fix it when I have time. Don’t waste your money on this p.o.c., take the time to buy a belt in person, like I should have done. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10019	segmentId=10019	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Not the same. The color was nothing like the photos !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10020	segmentId=10020	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Great color selection.... Fitbit band is comfortable and secures easily... nice color selections as well !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10021	segmentId=10021	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Good value and durable two point sling. Works well, does slide down a little without tension but overall good two point sling. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10022	segmentId=10022	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!This is what i need!!. It’s a mazing as i need. It will be perfect if there is 2 sizes because it will useful for the kids also. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10023	segmentId=10023	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!pretty good. bag. I was not dissapointed , big enough for my cloth for a week. I had it for carry on in the plane. The zippers were good, almost going to easy. I also think the bag looks nice. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10024	segmentId=10024	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Nice EDC tool but needs a couple mods.. The retraction feature was annoying because you couldn't apply any pressure without the blade disappearing. I yanked out the spring with a small screwdriver... just get under there and yank it till it breaks free. I also replaced the blade with harder carbide steel. I use it quite often and it's part of my EDC. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10025	segmentId=10025	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Good product, but too big. This is exactly what I'm looking for. However, when I put these on, there is a lot of space and extra fabric (way too big). My left hand measures at 18 cm and right hand at 19.5 cm so I ordered a size Small according to the table, but they're still too big. Would be great if these were also available in XS. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10026	segmentId=10026	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Works just fine. Mounted easily and no, the screws are not too long. I read the reviews and other than folks who were putting the thing on backwards (the holes won't line up!!), the most common complaints are the screws are too soft and that the screws are too long and bind up the bolt. I did not run into either of these problems. I screwed the base down, mounted some rings, and away I went. Works great and was an inexpensive solution. Is it super high end?? No. Is it adequate for what's likely 99% of the users out there? In my opinion, yes. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10027	segmentId=10027	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Compactable and light weight. Very compactable and light weight. The stakes are durable and tie out points are well made. Wish it had a few more tie outs on the sides. Mine only came with one on each corner, one in the middle of each side and a center tie out. Used this as a lean-to shelter over my tent. The heat from the fire rolled right into my tent and was very comfortable in 24 degree weather. I pulled, wrenched and stretched this tarp with no issues. Also love that it is very easy to fold back up into its pouch. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10028	segmentId=10028	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Plastic hanger but it works. Has worked on 7mm thick hunting waders with 1200 gram winter boots. Kind of expensive for a plastic hanger that could break, but so far so good. Hanger should have been made thicker. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10029	segmentId=10029	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Cleans up the ends of the bars. Cleans up the ends of the bars nicely. Stay in place better than the stock friction-fit rubber plugs. Weigh a few grams more though, so not for weight watchers... !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10030	segmentId=10030	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Excellent. Kept water with no ice cold for 12 hours !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10031	segmentId=10031	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Five Stars. Quick delivery and good product !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10032	segmentId=10032	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Effective Tool, Well Built, Worth It. This has been a huge hit for my sales team. It’s taken our customer engagement events to another level. It’s built well, sturdy, and easy to use. Super pleased with the purchase. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10033	segmentId=10033	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Happy customer. Everything was as stated. Recommend for anyone who needs more bands for there Apple Watch. !#nexlpEOL#!

threadId=10035	segmentId=10035	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Fantastic Quality Waterproof Drawstring. I purchased this drawstring backpack as I make frequent trips to the beach to go swimming or surfing. Thus far I have been very impressed. It was packaged very compactly and appears to fold down easily for storage or travel purposes. It appears significantly higher quality than your regular run-of-the-mill drawstring as the straps are firmly attached and will not untie like regular ones do - further they have buckles for length and comfort adjustment. The size capacity also appears to be very generous - I am easily able to fit a towel as well as other beach items inside without issue. The waterproof compartment at the bottom is excellent, and easily fits my US > 10 size shoes. I'm sure it would make a great use for packing a lunch or picnic items. The zipper straps are also very colorful and of a well-suited color scheme. If I were to lose this bag I would definitely choose to purchase it again, as it has performed its duty well thus far. Will update this review if anything changes but it seems like it will hold up well to usage and the weather! !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10036	segmentId=10036	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Great rackets for the price. Great rackets for the price. We been using it for a few weeks, still in pretty good shape. light weight compare with other beginner level rackets, came with a decent carrier too !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10037	segmentId=10037	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Great fit. Thanks that was fast and fits great. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10038	segmentId=10038	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Comfortable straps!. In high school I had an Adidas bag for club soccer that was this style. Being that I didn't know this brand I was skeptical but this bag is even better than my Adidas. The zippers are good quality and the backpack straps are EXCELLENT. Way more comfortable than my previous bag. Highly recommended. The inside zipper pocket is great for keys and headphones for the gym, the shoe pockets are great (size 10 sneaks fits good). Outside mesh pocket is usually meant for a soccer ball, but i use it for damp clothes after swimming etc. For $23, just buy it. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10039	segmentId=10039	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Five Stars. My new EDC! I will never leave home without it and getting my wife one !#nexlpEOL#!
