threadId=10015	segmentId=10015	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Crotch blew out first kneel. So during 2nd Rifle season, up in the Colorado mountains, on Day 6 of the hunt.. mother nature decided to gift us with ~8 inches of snow. Finally, I had the opportunity to try out my Frogg Togg's and pull them out of my ruck. For the first couple hours, standing up right and walking through the snow looking for elk tracks, they worked great. They kept my legs dry and provided an extra layer of insulation. Despite it being around 13 degrees, my legs and torso were fine and I actually overhearing if anything after about an hour of walking in the snow. Then, we get back to the camp site.... We decided to throw on the snow chains to the truck in case we got can animal and needed mobility to move it. I took my first knee in my brand new, first time ever worn Frogg Togg bottoms... and the crotch blew out. Talk about disappointment. Maybe I received a defective product? Manufacturer/Amazon seller, please let me know if this is true. Or, is taking a knee while wearing these just out if the question? I was wearing 1 layer of thin poly pro's, one pair of super thin athletic pants (ADIDAS), a pair of Carhart hunting pants bottoms, and then XXL Frogg Togg bottoms when this happened. I felt like I was swimming in my clothing and was not expecting the crotch to pop. I mean, I could understand if I was wearing a Large, maybe even a XL, but come on..it was a 2XL. Am I supposed to be rocking 3 or 4X in order to be able to perform a simple function such as taking a knee? In closing.. thankfully the top I have is in good shape and no issues so far. Buyers beware. At least for the pants... which is what you need most! if I wanted to only protect my top, I would have went with my poncho. !#nexlpEOL#!

I'm 6'2" which isn't too freakishly tall imo and squats are in the guide book! This is a dangerous design flaw. 0/10 recommend! It might still work for the other exercises that don't stretch the band as far, such as half rep bicep curls, but I wouldn't risk it unless you like getting shot in the face ;) I'm sending this piece of garbage back asap and getting one of those cheap ones without the handles or the hidden bullets. !#nexlpEOL#!

threadId=10089	segmentId=10089	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Love it, and it's so beautiful. Love it, and it's so beautiful. But didn't give 5 stars because the seem could be neater. I'm hoping that it will hold up to repeated usage. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10090	segmentId=10090	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Strong light with good build.. I haven't been able to use it tracking a critter yet. I have tested it in various "simulations" to ensure it will help me. I got it because I'm red/green color blind so I sometimes struggle picking up blood on it's own which is frustrating. I do feel this will help me greatly after testing it out. The strength of the light and overall build quality is excellent. I now keep it in my hunting pack at all times to help when the moment comes. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10091	segmentId=10091	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Great value!. Very comfortable and sturdy. Great amount of compression! !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10092	segmentId=10092	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!So, so. It does the job, but not as sturdy as we had hoped. We thought that we were getting a higher grade of metal, but it is what we ordered. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10093	segmentId=10093	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Did not come in Color Pictured.. I suppose product color is irrelevant due to what the intended use of this product is, but I'm still a little salty. 4 stars. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10094	segmentId=10094	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!The flexibility of the mirrors is great. I had a difficult time fitting one of the two mirrors in my bike handle. One side fits ok, but I could not get the other one all the way in the other side. Other than that, it's a nice mirror. I love the fact that it's adjustable in many ways, which gave me the flexibility I need. And it looks good on my black bike. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10095	segmentId=10095	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Great chair.. A little small but perfect for a ground blind. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10096	segmentId=10096	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!I like this item. I like this item, easy to set up and use. The only thing I don't like is trying to get it back in the bag. ugh I bought a golf mat too so I could use it in my hall. Would be nice if a mat was included. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10097	segmentId=10097	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Great rings!. I need a half size smaller. Love the variety of rings I received . Very comfortable!!!! !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10098	segmentId=10098	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Four Stars. Fast delivery to Canada. Thanks !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10099	segmentId=10099	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Four Stars. Works but not as nice to turn and use to tighten. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10100	segmentId=10100	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!A little dirty but it's a sword. First sword I bought on Amazon and honestly not that disappointed, the only critique that I have is that it came and what looks like very used condition there's stains all over the sword itself and the sheath, it also had a very weird smell to it. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10101	segmentId=10101	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Price. Nice build, fits perfect. Great product for the price. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10102	segmentId=10102	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Four Stars. Work great. After a couple tailgates these start losing grain. No major complaints though. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10103	segmentId=10103	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!but still looks good. Looks like it might last through some rough .... The silver in the band isn't as silver or shinny as in pictures, but still looks good. Looks like it might last through some rough wear, but we'll see. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10104	segmentId=10104	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Good buy. Loved it! However, some of these come with a little design that has a pointy end (ex. The star) and at times itâ€™s uncomfortable for the kids. But bc you get so many you have plenty of options of the safer ones. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10105	segmentId=10105	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Make sure you measure first. Advice.. Measure twice & order once. Looks to be very good quality, unfortunately I ordered too large so waiting for the new one. Confident it will be of equal quality. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10106	segmentId=10106	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!GREAT. Very pleased with this purchase .. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10107	segmentId=10107	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Four Stars. Surprisingly good for a low-budget knife! !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10108	segmentId=10108	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!good survival knife, can chop cut not good for fine work. Good knife, what I expect from Cold Steel but in personal preference I like the bowie !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10109	segmentId=10109	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Wide measuring tape. Nice tape, easy to read in centimeters or inches, but it is too wide for the edge of kayak so I had to cut it down to size, fast shipping !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10110	segmentId=10110	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Entertaining and fun. Canâ€™t speak about durability yet but theyâ€™ve been very popular with the kids and have allowed us to play when dark out! !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10111	segmentId=10111	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Four Stars. Great rod for the price and great feel. With the Stealth reel itâ€™s a winner. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10112	segmentId=10112	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Love them. The material on the backhand is breathable so I've never felt my hands get overly sweaty because I was wearing these. If/when the pair I bought has finally seen its last day, I'll be buying another pair of these. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10113	segmentId=10113	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Great Value. This is a great discus for the price. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10114	segmentId=10114	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Excellent Quality!!. This is a GREAT belt! I love everything about it and am really enjoying wearing it everyday. Really excellent quality. A+++ !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10115	segmentId=10115	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Awesome Clips. Great for the price, can't beat it. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10116	segmentId=10116	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Extreamly high quality with maximum comfort fit. Extreamly comfortable material, very soft and form fitting. Doesnt even feel like its there !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10117	segmentId=10117	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Good buy for excellent quality. Excellent- good support for injuries. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10118	segmentId=10118	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Great laces!. Recently bought three sets of these laces in different colors. Have replaced all of the tie laces in my sneakers with these and am very happy. They were easy to use and have eliminated that feeling of your shoes tightening as your feet swell throughout the day. Plus they make putting your shoes on and off so much easier. Of course they frayed after cutting them, but that is no big deal as they ends are entrapped in the end closure. Good bargain that this price. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10119	segmentId=10119	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Really packable!. They advertise that you can roll the hat---and you can! !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10120	segmentId=10120	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Great product, I'm not a 5 star guy but this deserves it!. Very thick coated metal, easy assembly. Will definitely buy again if needed. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10121	segmentId=10121	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Perfect bottle for me. This water bottle is exactly what I had been searching for. Itâ€™s lightweight, and itâ€™s easy for me to take everywhere. It does not leak at all. I absolutely love this bottle! !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10122	segmentId=10122	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Amazing.. Good quality classes, bought them for my girlfriend. She loves them, the only complaint is the tint is lighter so donâ€™t expect high sun deflection. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10123	segmentId=10123	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Great cooling towels at a great price!. We bought these for a family trip to Lake Powell where summer daytime temperatures are regularly over 100. These cooling towels worked great to provide cooling relief from the heat. The multi-pack with 6 colors was great because everyone in my family got one and we could keep them straight. Highly recommended! !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10124	segmentId=10124	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!nice, fashionable and easy to install. love the bands--will will order more colors-easy to install as well !#nexlpEOL#!

I will definitely buy more. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10126	segmentId=10126	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Keep on stepping!. This works great. I love the comfort of the band, it fits just right. It has been keeping me in track getting my daily steps in. I am shocked how much I wake up with the sleep app.. very enlightening !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10127	segmentId=10127	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Highly Recommend.. Just what I needed to sharpen my Arrow Broadheads. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10128	segmentId=10128	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Notifies me. I have been looking for a low price smart watch, and I finally found one. It not only tracks fitness, and heart rate, but it notifies me when I have a call or text. Something that not all of the fitness watches do.. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10129	segmentId=10129	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!The perfect backpack for me. The perfect backpack for me. Allows me to carry a change of clothes,tablet and my laptop to and from work. I've also used it as a camera backpack. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10130	segmentId=10130	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Great product. Works great as long as you dont submerge.... Great product !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10131	segmentId=10131	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!It works very wel, please do not change it!!!!. I do not plan on using any other broad head until I cannot purchase these! They haven't let me down yet. !#nexlpEOL#!

threadId=10136	segmentId=10136	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!NICE!!. These feel great! I was hoping the cut was lower, but theyâ€™ll be fine with long pants. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10137	segmentId=10137	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Bigger than expected. Bigger than i expected. Great gift !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10138	segmentId=10138	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Five Stars. Nice quality well built. The gate mouth works well push it open and it stays open. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10139	segmentId=10139	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Give it time after you inflate it. The ball comes not inflated, and when you first inflate it, it looks lopsided, since it was packed for a while. After a bit of time, it looks perfectly round. Works great! !#nexlpEOL#!
