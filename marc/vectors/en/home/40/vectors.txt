threadId=10000	segmentId=10000	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Not comfortable for a husband and wife. The mattress topper is not comfortable for a couple, especially if they cuddle at night. The mattress concaved around my wife and I to the point that if either of us was close to the other it felt like we would fall into their hole. It was a lot like sleeping on a sagging air mattress. Maybe this topper is comfortable for those that sleep alone or maybe mine was defective - I have no idea why it is so highly rated on Amazon. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10001	segmentId=10001	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Terrible quality. Broke in the first week don't waste your money !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10002	segmentId=10002	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Only received one pillow on an order of two?. I only got one pillow on the order even tho you pay for two. Also it is way darker than the picture shows. Not real happy about this order. I can’t seem to get ahold of anyone to get my other pillow. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10003	segmentId=10003	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Cheap materials. Very cheap plastic. I couldn’t get the drawers to open one at a time they all slid open when trying to open one. I even filled them up with items hoping they would then slide better, but it didn’t work. It is also very noice and squeaks when opening. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10004	segmentId=10004	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Does not last. Stopped working after a month. Inside battery compartment is rusted out. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10005	segmentId=10005	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!That the material is extra thin. This what a bad choice for me. The pockets in these chair covers are cheaply made. The material is extra thin as you can see. I placed these on one of the folding chairs & as you can see it ripped due to the material being extra thin. They did however come on time as promised . I wish I would have made another choice. I don’t recommend these chair covers. I will be returning the Un open box of 50 that I wasn’t able to use. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10006	segmentId=10006	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!One Star. Never received item. Money is gone! !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10007	segmentId=10007	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Don't like. Ordered for my husband. He hated it. Pillow is way too firm. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10008	segmentId=10008	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!It's Garbage!. the fan stop working after almost a month of using it, tried to change the fuse it still doesn't work, my 10 dollar plastic fans are still running overpriced piece of shit! !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10009	segmentId=10009	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Not silky at all. Bought this in silver and black to try to make my hair softer and smoother. Cheap price too good to be true! Feels like very obvious fake silk. Returned immediately. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10010	segmentId=10010	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Soft but not durable. These unfortunately fell apart after one wash in cold water and low heat dryer. They’re very soft, and mostly wrinkle resistant, but not durable at all! !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10011	segmentId=10011	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!They are too heavy. I did not like them they are too heavy they are too noisy !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10012	segmentId=10012	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Ehh. This product takes forever to get the wrinkles out of your clothes and you have to keep filling it up with water. It's really annoying to have to keep running to the sink to refill it. It is a more ideal for removing wrinkles for maybe like one clothing item. I like to remove the wrinkles out of my clothes after doing laundry and I usually have a couple clothing items and I cannot efficiently get it done with this product. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10013	segmentId=10013	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Hard to tie. I have not found a quick and easy way to successfully tie these so the beads don’t all fall off ; hard for my 8yr old !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10014	segmentId=10014	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Glass Decal and not a wall decal. The product says it is wall decal but it is a glass decal. cannot stick it on wall. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10015	segmentId=10015	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!The pleather already tore.. It lasted a week....the pleather already tore. Pretty bellows, not made for use, good for display. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10016	segmentId=10016	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Ripped upon washing. Love the look. Sheets arrived, I put them in the wash, and as I was putting the pillowcase on I noticed a large rip. Not sure if it was shipped that way or if they ripped in the wash. Was hoping for better quality. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10017	segmentId=10017	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Not like the picture. Product does not look anything like the picture !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10018	segmentId=10018	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Good but quantity not up to par. The containers were barely half full. If they were the right amount I would have loved them cause they were perfect but most def not 1800 of them !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10019	segmentId=10019	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!not a good replacement. This is definitely not the original replacement part which hoover used to make. It does say that in the description, but it also makes you feel like you are getting a decent replacement for it, meaning the bristles should be the same direction as the original replacement part. This fits, but the Bristles on the roller all go in a circular pattern. The original roller had bristles at the one end that went in a "v" so the dirt would be pushed toward the opening of the suction hole. This roller the bristles are continuous, like wrapped around with a single ribbon, so dirt gets pushed all out to one side and sometimes spits out of the bottom side of the vacuum because there isn't the "v" formation of bristles on the one end to stop the motion and push it toward the suction hole. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10020	segmentId=10020	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Great Card!. Really fine detail. Bought for my nurse wife. She loved it! !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10021	segmentId=10021	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Four Stars. Looks great. Easy to install. Will probably buy again for additional storage needs. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10022	segmentId=10022	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Be careful on the print size. It is slightly smaller that advertised. Only an issue because I printed a large collage an some of the images on the outer edge were small. Single images will likely print great as long as there is not anything on the edge of the photo. Best bet is to be very cognizant of the cropping. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10023	segmentId=10023	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!O.k.. Not as large as I thought. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10024	segmentId=10024	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Perfect bedroom deco.. Nice quality- heavier than I expected. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10025	segmentId=10025	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Four Stars. will use them on hard seat church pews !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10026	segmentId=10026	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Unassembled. The picture shown is of an assembled finished piece. The item is well made and beautifully painted, but comes unassembled; I assume since there are 24 small toys, this is so the toys can be put in the compartments and one taken out each day to complete the display at the end of advent, which is why it comes unassembled. However, the toys are very small and fall over easily, especially when you wind the base to play the music. I also feel they could easily be lost, so I glued the pieces down to make them permanent and will put fun treats; i.e., Hershey kisses, miniature peanut butter cups, etc. in the compartments. The compartments are small, each holding about 2 Hershey kisses, so if you want to put gift cards or larger candies in them, it will not work. Not all fun size candy bars will fit. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10027	segmentId=10027	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Nice but lacks clarity. Nice theme for my autumn bathroom. The image is not as vibrant as I imagined, but I'm content. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10028	segmentId=10028	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!VERY NICE, WITH SIGNIFICANT ADJUSTMENT. Some adjustment is needed in order to get this hanging basket to look like the picture. Actually, a lot of adjustment. Fortunately the stems, which are overly long, do bend if patiently worked with and in time I'll be happier with the "look" of this basket than I presently am. A few more blossoms would have been nice, too, but overall this faux-plant definitely looks like a geranium. The colors and the leaf/blossom sizes are excellent. So while it's still a work-in-progress, I'm reasonably pleased with this purchase and actually am enjoying remodeling it. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10029	segmentId=10029	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Good Product. I've been pretty happy with this cushion after using it for several months now. The only issue I have with it is that is tends to slip around a bit. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10030	segmentId=10030	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!All the space. Great for space saving. I bought these to store our extra comforter bed sets and blankets and I’ve used 2 large bags and one medium and I’ve been able to fit 2 comforter sets and sheet and most of our blankets in them. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10031	segmentId=10031	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Good price, easy to put together. So cute & easy to put together !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10032	segmentId=10032	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Five Stars. Exactly what it says. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10033	segmentId=10033	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Very good product. Very Nice and large bag exactly what we need to store our christmas tree in for the off season !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10034	segmentId=10034	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Good storage containers. The storage is some big and lid works well. Can get a lot in them. Was worth the money. Thank you. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10035	segmentId=10035	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Perfect for someone with vision issues. Lots of space to write on.. Purchased this for my dad, who has some vision issues. He's 82 and prefers a large print calendar. This calendar can be seen from a distance and has plenty of space to write your appointments in. He really likes it. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10036	segmentId=10036	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Very nice. Very clean looking and soft to the touch. I love it !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10037	segmentId=10037	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!it makes our house smell like the forest. I like the Pine smell because I like the woods and the Pine reminds me of the woods. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10038	segmentId=10038	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Affordable watercolor paper. For the price this is the best paper. I love painting on this Very good product. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10039	segmentId=10039	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Cute and good quality.. Good quality and super cute. Bought a pair for my couch and love them. !#nexlpEOL#!
