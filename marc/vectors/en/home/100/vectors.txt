threadId=200002	segmentId=200002	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!The product is junk.. I received my first order of this product and it was broke so I ordered it again. The second one was broke in more places than the first. I can't blame the shipping process as it's shrink wrapped and boxed. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=200006	segmentId=200006	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Not reliable ☹️. Ordered 2 they shipped 1 promised by certain day, then the next day, then the next day. !#nexlpEOL#!

threadId=200070	segmentId=200070	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Bad quality white board. This board could have been a perfect board for my son, but the stain does not come out from white board and the white board plastic (the materiel) started getting wrinkles. It is difficult to get any thing out of white board for adults, kids cannot remove it at all with the eraser or a cloth. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=200076	segmentId=200076	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Very disappointed in something that had such rave reviews. I just received it and the packaging had been opened and the soleplate cleaner was no where to be found. All I have are the cleaning cloths. Very disappointed in something that had such rave reviews!!! !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=200077	segmentId=200077	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Buyer Beware! Nothing like the picture!. I try my best to be positive about my purchases from Amazon but this one I cannot be. This tree is the most cheaply made poorly constructed tree I’ve ever purchased. And now I have to keep it because I have three kids ready to decorate their Christmas tree this evening. This tree looks like it is been constructed by elementary school children and put together with glue. I am very unhappy with this purchase it looks nothing like the picture! My poor kids are going to be so sad as our tree falls apart! !#nexlpEOL#!

threadId=200105	segmentId=200105	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Don't keep a flame/no crackling. Bought these for my homemade candles.

threadId=200116	segmentId=200116	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Don't waste your money!. Color is faded out. But when you take a picture it enhances the color for some inexplicable reason!!! Don't waste your money. When you want to return it you have to pay for shipping so to cut your losses you wind up taking their ridiculous settlement/discount and just keep it. Then use it as a shower liner. What a scam! Beware of Amazon third party sellers and don't deal with this one. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=200127	segmentId=200127	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Soft but Not at all cooling. Love the feel of the sheet set but very disappointed in the cooling effect that your website describe. It is not at all cooling when sleeping. In fact tit gets really warm and still waking up sweating. This purchase was completely unsatisfied. I washed it so I have to keep it. I am very disappointed in this product. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=200130	segmentId=200130	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Shredded after a few months. I really liked these sheets at first but after a few months they are shredded. They came apart and now have 18” holes in them. I definitely will not buy again! !#nexlpEOL#!

The size is nothing compared to the pic & the color is way way pale. The piece I received has only a slim strip of amethyst down the middle of the rough outter stone & the color couldn't be lighter. I don't know how to return it. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=200173	segmentId=200173	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Doesn't do anything. I got this when I was a lot newer to crafting and it seemed like the roller would be a big help especially since most of the crafts I was doing were mod podge based. I opted to buy this here because it was cheaper than at the crafting stores like Michaels but regrettably paying any price for this was a waste. The roller does practically nothing. There's very little weight to it so it doesn't really give you much pressure other than your own when using and when you try to use it to spread mod podge it doesn't, it moves right over it or if you try to smooth something like paper after you've applied it nothing happens either. I've saved the rubber squeegee as I use that when handling some vinyl projects. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=200176	segmentId=200176	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Too small. Return in progress as item was not the advertised size. Fell at least 6 inches short in width. !#nexlpEOL#!

threadId=240051	segmentId=240051	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Extremely bright light even when dimmed. This is unbelievably bright even on the lowest dimmest setting.

threadId=240074	segmentId=240074	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Does not last.. I used this pillow for a few months before it separated width wide. Now it has 2 parts. I’m pretty disappointed with the product. I thought if I spent a little more it would be a good pillow. Not so! !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=240080	segmentId=240080	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Decent mattress cover.. If you sleep by yourself it's ok. But if you sleep with someone else, you roll together, and with it being memory foam even if you move away the indent is still there and you just slide back together. It also gets really hot. Even with the "gel" it seems to hold heat, and can get uncomfortably warm. Maybe if I went with a smaller thickness. !#nexlpEOL#!

threadId=240179	segmentId=240179	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Very small drawers for a very large price. First, these are so expensive for some small, cheap, plastic drawers. But they came to me very dirty and had scrapes that I can’t get off. If it wasn’t for the scrapes and the expensive price for such small drawers, I would have liked them more. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=240195	segmentId=240195	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!It okay. It dries out too fast but it it's good for a glass fountain pen I would not recommend it to use the refillable cartridge on this because it will dry out in it and you will have to Queen. !#nexlpEOL#!

threadId=320033	segmentId=320033	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Great, but if you need cold air, get an AC.. Great fan but don't expect 'cold' air. The air is cool but not cold. It does the job well enough to justify not buying an AC, but if you need real cooling power, get an AC as this fan just blows somewhat cool air. But nonetheless great fan. Only issue is that it is a bit wobbly on the stand but if you're not clumsy you won't knock it over. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=320051	segmentId=320051	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Perfect size but needs improvement. Was looking to make my shower look more organized. Perfect size and color for my modern shower. Unfortunately the water will accumulate since they didnt put enough holes for the water to flush out. I modified it with my drill and put holes all over the bottom now I dont have a mildew build up. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=320053	segmentId=320053	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Great molds for resin.. Pay close attention: you only get one (random) color glitter. I wish there were more pipettes, I use a lot of those. Also, wish there were double if the smaller tiny molds (like the cat shape) for things like earrings. The ring mold is really too small for me (and most people I know) but my kid likes playing with the one and only ring I made. The bangle mold won’t go over my wrist (the product it makes won’t) but I mostly use it to set extra resin. Glitter sticks to it like CRAZY but glitter sticks to everything. Hard to clean off. It’s also difficult to remove anything from the taller skinny molds but still good for the price. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=320093	segmentId=320093	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Performs Well.... Should work well for anyone with fine line marker needs...Price is good, too! Take Care! !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=320095	segmentId=320095	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!A great budget candle.. This product is decent, the internal timer doesn't last from year to year and usually just ends up staying on 100% of the time. It looks great in the window, and produces a nice bright light. !#nexlpEOL#!

threadId=320127	segmentId=320127	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Sturdy but replace the mounting screws right away.. Very sturdy Only issues I had were the brass mounting screws. The do snap so I replaced them with sturdy screws. Not a deal breaker at all. I also took a drop of ca glue and glued the round risers onto the main bar. Huge time saver if you are installing solo. It holds the risers in place while you attach the shelf. !#nexlpEOL#!

threadId=320184	segmentId=320184	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Perfect. I'm still pregnant with my baby girl. But the onesie looks just as its pictured online and the fabric is very soft and silky. I'm just a little upset that the head band is a sort of DIY thing. I guess I have to learn to tie a bow lol. Other than that it's perfect and I can't wait to see my little girl wear it. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=320241	segmentId=320241	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Odd. Came packaged nicely, however it was covered in lint..???? Super comfortable but the lint was rather annoying to remove. !#nexlpEOL#!

threadId=320259	segmentId=320259	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Great color on the teal blanket!. I bought the teal color in both twin size and king size. The color is true to the picture - very bright. The twin size came rolled up in it's own container. The king size came vacuum packed and have may have been a return previously. I hope not b/c these are gifts. I did unzip the container and the blanket feels very soft. There is no smell. The price was great. So it is white on the sherpa side and teal on the top side. Now to the sage/green one. Very pale color but otherwise same as above. Again, a gift. !#nexlpEOL#!

I have a memory foam top layer on my mattress that I felt wasn't supporting me by the morning. My new topper firms it up while remaining soft and comfortable. Also just moved to CA, and I don't think it's hotter to sleep on than my regular mattress at all. If anything it actually cools me down a bit. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=360026	segmentId=360026	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Great shape. Pyramid as described, well done. The stone is black and beautiful, it surface is unpolished but very soft .

threadId=360148	segmentId=360148	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Perfect pillow for me!. This pillow is the best thing I have ever purchased in my life! It’s so comfortable I feel like I’m sleeping in a cloud. It feels like I’m being cuddled on both sides. I’m 29 weeks pregnant at the moment and I have yet to be uncomfortable because of my belly. This pillow is a miracle. I can’t even lay on it without sleeping. I do, however have to buy more filling from the pillow losing a little firmness. Also in the picture it looks longer, but that doesn’t bother me. I will definitely be using this even after I’ve had my baby. I 100% recommend this buy. No regrets. !#nexlpEOL#!

threadId=360180	segmentId=360180	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Luxurious!. I still can't believe I dropped this much money on a duvet cover, it was more than the new down comforter we also bought! But I have to say, after just sitting it out in the (very elegant) packaging for about a week while convincing myself it was worth it I just could not bring myself to return it. So I finally unwrapped it and put it on the bed. It's sooooooo nice. The fabric is very nice quality and the print is crisp, deep, and a lot more intricate than a picture can show. The one we selected is all in rich tones of blue on a white background. Our bedroom is a pale yellow color and I wasn't sure I'd like such a strong, single tone like blue in a yellow room, but I do. I experimented with a couple different colored sets of bed linen and really like them all, especially a lighter yellow set and a stark white with some silvery gray accents. All the stitching is very well done and I have not found a single spot that needed attention. Each inside corner has ties that can be used on a comforter that has corresponding tabs, and the ties are just the right length to easily attach without struggling. It has a concealed button closure right at the edge and this makes both sides available to be face up. There were no odd smells when removing it from the packaging. I set it up right from the package, intending to only spread it out to look at then wash, but got lazy and just left it. The fabric is quite stiff with whatever product the manufacturer uses. While it means the cover is pretty much perfect right out of the box in appearances I don't like the stiffness, and it makes a rustling sound similar to waxed tissue paper when moving assertions at night. I plan to gently wash it soon and do not expect any issues from that. We ordered the king size and received king size pillow shams, which I wasn't expecting. It's fine, but we don't have that size pillows and honestly I don't plan to use them for sleeping anyway. I like the trim detail on the shams. Top use them you just insert the pillow through an opening in the center of the back. No buttons or need to fold fabric over anything. I'd also planned to buy a waterproof cover fire the duvet, mostly for the "dust" that down sometimes produces that escapes through fabric, but I don't think I need to with this set. The fabric of this cover is very, very dense and thick. I may still buy one since we have kids and pets, just to be safe. Dunno. So yeah, I do recommend this if you can accept the cost at first. I've never heard of this brand but I also don't buy linens or generally care about that kind of stuff. It came nicely packaged in a fancy cardboard box, wrapped in tissue paper, and neatly folded in a matching cloth bag with handles (that I plan to reuse to carry some files for a monthly meeting). I ordered some simple king sized pillows so I can go ahead and use the shams. I'd purchase this brand again but a seriously don't see this set ever wearing out or getting ratty. Sometimes it's nice to just splurge. !#nexlpEOL#!
