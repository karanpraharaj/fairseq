threadId=10000	segmentId=10000	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!The product is junk.. I received my first order of this product and it was broke so I ordered it again. The second one was broke in more places than the first. I can't blame the shipping process as it's shrink wrapped and boxed. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10001	segmentId=10001	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Not reliable ☹️. Ordered 2 they shipped 1 promised by certain day, then the next day, then the next day. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10002	segmentId=10002	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!stems were broken. Stems were broken due to poor packing. Shapes are way different from the pictures. Blemishes in the skin. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10003	segmentId=10003	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Poor quality. The wicker baskets all unravel. Cheaply made. I reached out for replacements and heard nothing back. Going to send the whole thing back. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10004	segmentId=10004	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!This product is very easy to use. The first time is very good, very handy, but more than two times on the water, is not very normal. I gave him credit. Deleted. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10005	segmentId=10005	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Not happy with customer service.. Polishing filter defective. Contacted the company got no response . !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10006	segmentId=10006	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Bad quality white board. This board could have been a perfect board for my son, but the stain does not come out from white board and the white board plastic (the materiel) started getting wrinkles. It is difficult to get any thing out of white board for adults, kids cannot remove it at all with the eraser or a cloth. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10007	segmentId=10007	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Very disappointed in something that had such rave reviews. I just received it and the packaging had been opened and the soleplate cleaner was no where to be found. All I have are the cleaning cloths. Very disappointed in something that had such rave reviews!!! !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10008	segmentId=10008	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Buyer Beware! Nothing like the picture!. I try my best to be positive about my purchases from Amazon but this one I cannot be. This tree is the most cheaply made poorly constructed tree I’ve ever purchased. And now I have to keep it because I have three kids ready to decorate their Christmas tree this evening. This tree looks like it is been constructed by elementary school children and put together with glue. I am very unhappy with this purchase it looks nothing like the picture! My poor kids are going to be so sad as our tree falls apart! !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10009	segmentId=10009	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Not durable. Almost every peach balloon popped after a few mins of inflating. The color is very nice. I wish it was durable. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10010	segmentId=10010	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Didn’t get what was expected. Did not get the Pom poms. Just received the globes and then fan like decorations. Super disappointed !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10011	segmentId=10011	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!BUY BUT STAY AWAre. Great Product but as time passes gets worse. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10012	segmentId=10012	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Only one box???. When i ordered this item i was expecting to receive 5 little boxes as pictured... Nope one little box! Not worth the price!!! !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10013	segmentId=10013	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Don't keep a flame/no crackling. Bought these for my homemade candles. The wicks are thin and do not keep a flame or burn out completely. Going to try doubling or tripling up and soaking in oil so they dnt go completely to waste. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10014	segmentId=10014	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Don't waste your money!. Color is faded out. But when you take a picture it enhances the color for some inexplicable reason!!! Don't waste your money. When you want to return it you have to pay for shipping so to cut your losses you wind up taking their ridiculous settlement/discount and just keep it. Then use it as a shower liner. What a scam! Beware of Amazon third party sellers and don't deal with this one. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10015	segmentId=10015	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Soft but Not at all cooling. Love the feel of the sheet set but very disappointed in the cooling effect that your website describe. It is not at all cooling when sleeping. In fact tit gets really warm and still waking up sweating. This purchase was completely unsatisfied. I washed it so I have to keep it. I am very disappointed in this product. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10016	segmentId=10016	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Shredded after a few months. I really liked these sheets at first but after a few months they are shredded. They came apart and now have 18” holes in them. I definitely will not buy again! !#nexlpEOL#!

The size is nothing compared to the pic & the color is way way pale. The piece I received has only a slim strip of amethyst down the middle of the rough outter stone & the color couldn't be lighter. I don't know how to return it. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10021	segmentId=10021	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Doesn't do anything. I got this when I was a lot newer to crafting and it seemed like the roller would be a big help especially since most of the crafts I was doing were mod podge based. I opted to buy this here because it was cheaper than at the crafting stores like Michaels but regrettably paying any price for this was a waste. The roller does practically nothing. There's very little weight to it so it doesn't really give you much pressure other than your own when using and when you try to use it to spread mod podge it doesn't, it moves right over it or if you try to smooth something like paper after you've applied it nothing happens either. I've saved the rubber squeegee as I use that when handling some vinyl projects. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10022	segmentId=10022	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Too small. Return in progress as item was not the advertised size. Fell at least 6 inches short in width. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10023	segmentId=10023	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Broken when it arrived.. This product arrived with a bent pole and two missing rollers and not instructions to assemble. I promptly returned the item and went to a local store to purchase. !#nexlpEOL#!

threadId=10031	segmentId=10031	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Do not buy. Don't plan on ever taking these down. They will peel the paint from your walls and leave black adhesive. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10032	segmentId=10032	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Don’t buy for wall use.. These will not stay on my son’s wall. They are currently falling off every time we turn around and will inevitably have to be thrown away. !#nexlpEOL#!

threadId=10035	segmentId=10035	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Clicking Noise when on, not quiet at all. I was worried when a few 1 star reviews mentioned a clicking noise. Turns out I was right to be worried. The clicking noise is loud and can not be mended without opening the fan, which I wouldn't recommend unless you want to ever return the fan. Sounds like something was made too long and hitting something constantly. I returned it to get another one to see if the issue was just the first fan. Wrong. Both did it. I do not recommend this at all. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10036	segmentId=10036	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!False advertising. I was supposed to receive two boxes and only received one. Amazon what is wrong with the packaging department? That huge envelope for one box? Amazon is getting worse with product quality. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10037	segmentId=10037	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Dont order if you expect them to come in 1 or 2 days.. I hate to be that person but this is honestly really annoying as a customer. I never got a chance to use these because I had to cancel the order I ordered over $35 worth of stuff on April 4th JUST to get these with 1 day delivery (which really is 2 days depending on what time you order) because I really needed these now and they only carry them online. Then I find out they wont be delivered until April 13th so not only are they not coming in the 1-2 days promised, its going to take them over a whole week to get here. I don't understand why these are on prime with a quick delivery date and further more I don't get why you are tricking people into ordering more stuff to get it to come quicker if its not going to be honored anyways. The regular prime shipping times aren't even honored. If you're ordering these don't expect them to come quick despite them being on prime/free 1-day !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10038	segmentId=10038	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Fun, but not enough paint.. Not enough paint for some colors, and they dry up easily. But it is fun. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10039	segmentId=10039	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Two Stars. Much smaller than I expected and the fur is slightly falling out. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10040	segmentId=10040	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Extremely bright light even when dimmed. This is unbelievably bright even on the lowest dimmest setting.

threadId=10041	segmentId=10041	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Does not last.. I used this pillow for a few months before it separated width wide. Now it has 2 parts. I’m pretty disappointed with the product. I thought if I spent a little more it would be a good pillow. Not so! !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10042	segmentId=10042	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Decent mattress cover.. If you sleep by yourself it's ok. But if you sleep with someone else, you roll together, and with it being memory foam even if you move away the indent is still there and you just slide back together. It also gets really hot. Even with the "gel" it seems to hold heat, and can get uncomfortably warm. Maybe if I went with a smaller thickness. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10043	segmentId=10043	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Very light weight. Very light weight with no backing. Will not put them on an expensive blazer !#nexlpEOL#!

threadId=10051	segmentId=10051	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Very small drawers for a very large price. First, these are so expensive for some small, cheap, plastic drawers. But they came to me very dirty and had scrapes that I can’t get off. If it wasn’t for the scrapes and the expensive price for such small drawers, I would have liked them more. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10052	segmentId=10052	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!It okay. It dries out too fast but it it's good for a glass fountain pen I would not recommend it to use the refillable cartridge on this because it will dry out in it and you will have to Queen. !#nexlpEOL#!

What I dislike is the back rod doesn't stay in place on one end. Those foam holders you use does NOT keep rod in place on one end. I've tried contacting the rod maker for help but the page won't load. Not impressed at all with this company. !#nexlpEOL#!

threadId=10068	segmentId=10068	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Don't PayLess Or You'll Buy Twice. Lesson learned because I was honestly expecting a comparable product to similar products on the market. I've purchased 10 other similar shelves and this is by far the lowest quality (lighter gauge metal, weak casters, vertical shelving rows without cross bracing versus the usual horizontal base on the shelves). If you like quality products made with quality materials I would not recommend saving a few bucks. Gave it a star because it could work in a very low performing area like a closet for someone else. So in the end, depends on what you plan on using it for. !#nexlpEOL#!

threadId=10075	segmentId=10075	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!works well. This air purifier works well. It circulates the air in our bedroom at low speed without much noise.

threadId=10079	segmentId=10079	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Great, but if you need cold air, get an AC.. Great fan but don't expect 'cold' air. The air is cool but not cold. It does the job well enough to justify not buying an AC, but if you need real cooling power, get an AC as this fan just blows somewhat cool air. But nonetheless great fan. Only issue is that it is a bit wobbly on the stand but if you're not clumsy you won't knock it over. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10080	segmentId=10080	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Perfect size but needs improvement. Was looking to make my shower look more organized. Perfect size and color for my modern shower. Unfortunately the water will accumulate since they didnt put enough holes for the water to flush out. I modified it with my drill and put holes all over the bottom now I dont have a mildew build up. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10081	segmentId=10081	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Great molds for resin.. Pay close attention: you only get one (random) color glitter. I wish there were more pipettes, I use a lot of those. Also, wish there were double if the smaller tiny molds (like the cat shape) for things like earrings. The ring mold is really too small for me (and most people I know) but my kid likes playing with the one and only ring I made. The bangle mold won’t go over my wrist (the product it makes won’t) but I mostly use it to set extra resin. Glitter sticks to it like CRAZY but glitter sticks to everything. Hard to clean off. It’s also difficult to remove anything from the taller skinny molds but still good for the price. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10082	segmentId=10082	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Performs Well.... Should work well for anyone with fine line marker needs...Price is good, too! Take Care! !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10083	segmentId=10083	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!A great budget candle.. This product is decent, the internal timer doesn't last from year to year and usually just ends up staying on 100% of the time. It looks great in the window, and produces a nice bright light. !#nexlpEOL#!

threadId=10087	segmentId=10087	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Sturdy but replace the mounting screws right away.. Very sturdy Only issues I had were the brass mounting screws. The do snap so I replaced them with sturdy screws. Not a deal breaker at all. I also took a drop of ca glue and glued the round risers onto the main bar. Huge time saver if you are installing solo. It holds the risers in place while you attach the shelf. !#nexlpEOL#!

threadId=10093	segmentId=10093	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Perfect. I'm still pregnant with my baby girl. But the onesie looks just as its pictured online and the fabric is very soft and silky. I'm just a little upset that the head band is a sort of DIY thing. I guess I have to learn to tie a bow lol. Other than that it's perfect and I can't wait to see my little girl wear it. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10094	segmentId=10094	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Odd. Came packaged nicely, however it was covered in lint..???? Super comfortable but the lint was rather annoying to remove. !#nexlpEOL#!

You also need to purchase transfer paper with it. For sticker decals, this is ok, its easier than rolls in certain ways. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10096	segmentId=10096	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Great color on the teal blanket!. I bought the teal color in both twin size and king size. The color is true to the picture - very bright. The twin size came rolled up in it's own container. The king size came vacuum packed and have may have been a return previously. I hope not b/c these are gifts. I did unzip the container and the blanket feels very soft. There is no smell. The price was great. So it is white on the sherpa side and teal on the top side. Now to the sage/green one. Very pale color but otherwise same as above. Again, a gift. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10097	segmentId=10097	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Can’t working as highlight pens. Not as what I thought as the high light pens.But my daughter love them. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10098	segmentId=10098	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!I would buy this again.. I have a King 💤 # bed & it fits perfectly plus color is deep & rich as pictured. I have not washed it yet & I did have to air it out for a slight odor. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10099	segmentId=10099	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Four Stars. Hard to evaluate; I lost a pet and that is what this represents. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10100	segmentId=10100	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!comfy. good sheets for the price !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10101	segmentId=10101	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Four Stars. great craft brushes. a little too absorbent. sucks up most of my mod podge !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10102	segmentId=10102	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Four Stars. These are great little rollers, however they were too small for what I needed them for. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10103	segmentId=10103	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Fun light. Cute, fun and would make a great gift for all ages! !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10104	segmentId=10104	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Perfect for a boy. So soft - and such vivid colors! My grandson loves it - his big sister has a mermaid tail that made him just a little bit jealous, so now he's set with this "macho" one! I even got him a soft orange astronaut helmet to wear with it - it's perfect! (Gramma Scores!) !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10105	segmentId=10105	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Decent.. Decent quality, it does what I want/need it to. It will sit in my closet so wasn't looking for or expecting a "show piece", especially at the price. Not great but not horrible either, really about what I expected maybe a little better even for the price. Sure the finish could have been better, but it isn't an $100+ showpiece either. It did include the watch pillows which was nice and wasn't 100% expected also. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10106	segmentId=10106	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Decent Product. Works really well, but months later I still have to pick off little pieces of cotton on me from the towel after drying off. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10107	segmentId=10107	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Plate hangers. Exactly what I needed to hang my plates. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10108	segmentId=10108	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!I like it. Works well for our bathroom counter. We have really tiny counters so this is perfect to keep things organized and out of the way. Easy to clean and very nice to have. I recommend this product. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10109	segmentId=10109	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!If you sleep hot, this probably isn't for you.. I like this duvet but it's not for everyone. I chose this one because it claimed to be an all season duvet cover and so far that's held up true for winter, I haven't gotten to test it out in summer yet. I needed something to keep me warm yet be light enough to not cause my fiance to sleep hot, I didn't notice that the covering was 100% polyester and thus he still sleeps hot yet not as much as before. This is the only downside I have found in this duvet so far besides the fact that it doesn't fit properly in the two cal king duvet covers i purchased separately, it's about 4 inches smaller than my covers. But all in all it is a thin duvet that keeps me warm and is soft to the touch so I'm happy with it !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10110	segmentId=10110	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Nice decor for fall. Nice pillow covers. Great to put on over your existing pillow to update for the fall. Lightweight and should be easy to clean. !#nexlpEOL#!

threadId=10115	segmentId=10115	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Not getting a new mattress anymore. Wonderful to sleep on. Was considering getting a new mattress and I'm not anymore. I have a memory foam top layer on my mattress that I felt wasn't supporting me by the morning. My new topper firms it up while remaining soft and comfortable. Also just moved to CA, and I don't think it's hotter to sleep on than my regular mattress at all. If anything it actually cools me down a bit. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10116	segmentId=10116	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Great shape. Pyramid as described, well done. The stone is black and beautiful, it surface is unpolished but very soft . At first touch it stained my fingers with a fine black dust but after a thoroughly wash the pyramid did not stained my hand anymore. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10117	segmentId=10117	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!BEST CANDLE WITH BEST FRAGRANCE EVER!!!!!!!. I use to get these at this cute little shop in Eureka Springs, AR but since moved away and SO SO badly wanted these candles. They burn even the fragrance smells the whole house 2000 sq ft. I am a Candle freak and these are BY FAR the best I have ever burned. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10118	segmentId=10118	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Nice washcloths. The washcloths are very soft, I like the little handles they have, color variety is great as I and my children each use a different color. !#nexlpEOL#!

threadId=10124	segmentId=10124	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Happy Color. I use these vibrant yellow placemats for outdoor dinners. They are easy to clean. I love the yellow and with our round table they fit perfectly. They arrived wrapped in plastic and on time. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10125	segmentId=10125	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Perfect pillow for me!. This pillow is the best thing I have ever purchased in my life! It’s so comfortable I feel like I’m sleeping in a cloud. It feels like I’m being cuddled on both sides. I’m 29 weeks pregnant at the moment and I have yet to be uncomfortable because of my belly. This pillow is a miracle. I can’t even lay on it without sleeping. I do, however have to buy more filling from the pillow losing a little firmness. Also in the picture it looks longer, but that doesn’t bother me. I will definitely be using this even after I’ve had my baby. I 100% recommend this buy. No regrets. !#nexlpEOL#!

threadId=10128	segmentId=10128	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Luxurious!. I still can't believe I dropped this much money on a duvet cover, it was more than the new down comforter we also bought! But I have to say, after just sitting it out in the (very elegant) packaging for about a week while convincing myself it was worth it I just could not bring myself to return it. So I finally unwrapped it and put it on the bed. It's sooooooo nice. The fabric is very nice quality and the print is crisp, deep, and a lot more intricate than a picture can show. The one we selected is all in rich tones of blue on a white background. Our bedroom is a pale yellow color and I wasn't sure I'd like such a strong, single tone like blue in a yellow room, but I do. I experimented with a couple different colored sets of bed linen and really like them all, especially a lighter yellow set and a stark white with some silvery gray accents. All the stitching is very well done and I have not found a single spot that needed attention. Each inside corner has ties that can be used on a comforter that has corresponding tabs, and the ties are just the right length to easily attach without struggling. It has a concealed button closure right at the edge and this makes both sides available to be face up. There were no odd smells when removing it from the packaging. I set it up right from the package, intending to only spread it out to look at then wash, but got lazy and just left it. The fabric is quite stiff with whatever product the manufacturer uses. While it means the cover is pretty much perfect right out of the box in appearances I don't like the stiffness, and it makes a rustling sound similar to waxed tissue paper when moving assertions at night. I plan to gently wash it soon and do not expect any issues from that. We ordered the king size and received king size pillow shams, which I wasn't expecting. It's fine, but we don't have that size pillows and honestly I don't plan to use them for sleeping anyway. I like the trim detail on the shams. Top use them you just insert the pillow through an opening in the center of the back. No buttons or need to fold fabric over anything. I'd also planned to buy a waterproof cover fire the duvet, mostly for the "dust" that down sometimes produces that escapes through fabric, but I don't think I need to with this set. The fabric of this cover is very, very dense and thick. I may still buy one since we have kids and pets, just to be safe. Dunno. So yeah, I do recommend this if you can accept the cost at first. I've never heard of this brand but I also don't buy linens or generally care about that kind of stuff. It came nicely packaged in a fancy cardboard box, wrapped in tissue paper, and neatly folded in a matching cloth bag with handles (that I plan to reuse to carry some files for a monthly meeting). I ordered some simple king sized pillows so I can go ahead and use the shams. I'd purchase this brand again but a seriously don't see this set ever wearing out or getting ratty. Sometimes it's nice to just splurge. !#nexlpEOL#!

threadId=10132	segmentId=10132	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Firm and stylish tube pillow.. Perfect size for a queen sleeper sofa with arm rests. Ordered another one as soon as the first one came. Dark Grey matched sofa perfectly. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10133	segmentId=10133	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Professional Setup. I'm very happy with this unit. I've read a lot of bad things, but in my case everything is working as it should and I'm very happy with it.

threadId=10143	segmentId=10143	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Perfect sizing. Finally sheets that actually fit the Cal. King and are deep enough for a pillowtop mattress. Getting 4 pillow cases was a huge benefit because when you have a king you always use at least four pillows, a practical and nice looking set of sheets !#nexlpEOL#!

In reality it's a lovely purple like the flowers on the comforter. Nothing shrank when we washed it. It all came out perfect. My daughter loves it. !#nexlpEOL#!

It is very comfortable and I feel like a princess sleeping in my bed. I would definitely buy these again and other colors.
