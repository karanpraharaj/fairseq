threadId=10000	segmentId=10000	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!One Star. I ordered wrong size these have to be bigger than what you normally wear for some reason !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10001	segmentId=10001	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!False Advertisement. This did not say #10 or Messi. This was a gift for my son and he is very disappointed. Returning it. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10002	segmentId=10002	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Never shipped.. Never received product. Very disappointed. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10003	segmentId=10003	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Fit as expected, minus the thigh bands being a .... Fit as expected, minus the thigh bands being a bit too tight. My main concern is how extremely thin they are. They feel cheaply made and am certain they'll snag/run my first wear. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10004	segmentId=10004	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Poor quality. My husband said they were comfortable and all, but the second time he wore them the seam was already splitting up the back. And he doesn't have much of a butt, so it wasn't due to added pressure! !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10005	segmentId=10005	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Quality and confront.. I like the weight of the jacket but after standing in a heavy rain my back was damp. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10006	segmentId=10006	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!They were already torn. These stockings already had a huge run in them when I opened them up. Otherwise they would have been great. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10007	segmentId=10007	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Not what you see. Prettier in picture then in person !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10008	segmentId=10008	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Socks wrong size - too small!!. These socks are high quality but way too small!! !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10009	segmentId=10009	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Item never delivered and poor customer service! Don’t waste your time with this seller!. Ordered this item for my infant during this cold weather! Item stated it was delivered but I never received. Customer service was not great about replacing item as that’s what I wanted instead of refund! Not happy with service at all!!!! !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10010	segmentId=10010	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Get what you paid for :/. Definitely a one time use, material starts to stretch within a hour and just keeps stretching. material is pretty but would only buy for a small event or costume !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10011	segmentId=10011	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Somewhat disappointed. A little deceiving from Facebook add looked like a rubber mask not plastic. Suit seems fine . !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10012	segmentId=10012	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Not great quality. Material was not what expected !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10013	segmentId=10013	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Nice but not lasting.. I bought this July 27th and it's December 5th. I need to replace it because it is ripping apart at the seam. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10014	segmentId=10014	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Doesn’t last after 1 wash.. Loved this as soon as I put it on, very slimming. Washed it on DELICATE in a mesh bag, hung to dry. Went to wear it for the first time and saw most of the stiching came undone in the bust and was falling apart. Returning for money back. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10015	segmentId=10015	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Two Stars. Loos and feels cheap !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10016	segmentId=10016	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Great idea poorly implemented. I carry a bunch of stuff some related to an injury and a rather extensive first aid stuff so I need a lot of pockets. Got tired of caring a big back pack or bag. My first pocket vest is about to give up the ghost so I needed new one. Only thing I did was add snaps to some of the pockets to make sure they didn't open up by mistake. I also add stuff to it when I go camping. Revision. It's not cotton. The design is great but the implementation stinks. Had to make repairs on it due to crappie sewn seems. Not enough fabric at the stitches and they used crappie thread. I'm on my 6th or 7th repair and have not used it that much so far. Stitching is coming lose way to often. Junk. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10017	segmentId=10017	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Two Stars. WAY TO SMALL! Item is not as described.. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10018	segmentId=10018	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Fit not fab. The fabric of these shirts was thin and threads hanging out everywhere. Seemed very cheaply made. I loved the colors but the fit and fabric was not as what I expected !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10019	segmentId=10019	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Poor quality and runs small. This jacket is small and came unstitched after only several uses. Not a good example of American made. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10020	segmentId=10020	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Very cute! Waist runs small. Great looking item! Too cute but waist runs very small!!!! !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10021	segmentId=10021	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Great quality! Fast shipping.. Great quality! Fast shipping. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10022	segmentId=10022	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Trendy n comfy. Super cute and great material. 36ddd bit tight but workable and great for sucking in the tummy !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10023	segmentId=10023	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Comfy. Soft and comfortable. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10024	segmentId=10024	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!High quality. Great material and fit. Very durable. They hug your body and feel great. Very stretchy, and material doesn't show moisture. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10025	segmentId=10025	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Four Stars. it fits well with the exception it is a bit snug across the shoulders and bust area !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10026	segmentId=10026	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Triggers metal detectors. Nice wallet but it sets off the metal detectors at the airport. I have to put the wallet in my bag. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10027	segmentId=10027	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Good for the price.. Decently constructed for a cheap China product. I didn't see any major sewing flaws. Washed in cold water and air dried before first use. Totally useable. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10028	segmentId=10028	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Seems like a nice product. I tried it on when it arrived and it appears it will fit. I'm hoping it will block the sun, but since it's winter, I can't say for sure. Seems like a nice product though and I'm excited to have it. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10029	segmentId=10029	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!True to size. Fit to size. Like them a lot !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10030	segmentId=10030	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Goes great with plaid shirts.. This bolo tie is amazing! The first one I purchased and it goes so well with my style! I would definitely consider purchasing another bolo tie in the future !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10031	segmentId=10031	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!They are adorable!. This are so cute. The fabric is nice. They have a liner inside (shorts). And the seams line up so well with the fabric being striped !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10032	segmentId=10032	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Great for the price!. Perfect. Exactly what we wanted. My husband is 6’2” and 240 and it fit nicely. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10033	segmentId=10033	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Very warm.. Extremely warm. My favorite cold weather hoodie. !#nexlpEOL#!
