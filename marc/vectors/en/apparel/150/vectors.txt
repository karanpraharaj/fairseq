threadId=10000	segmentId=10000	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Picture Doesn’t Represent Well. There is a terribly done band across the top. Supposed to keep the shirt on your shoulders but seems more of like a waistband. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10001	segmentId=10001	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Not what I ordered. I am disappointed in this purchase. I bought one of these in another color and in size XL and it fit great. This one I bought in white in XL and it fits like a Medium. I cannot wear this top and am really disappointed about that, It is advertised as XL but seriously this top would only fit someone who would be a size s/m. An XXL would have been a better choice for me because the sizing is incorrect on this product. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10002	segmentId=10002	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Way too large. Buy one size smaller, they r BIG !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10003	segmentId=10003	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Width. Wrong size for my husband. I need to return them, unfortunately. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10004	segmentId=10004	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!knee highs. My mom loves the mild compression of the knee high but says the top is too loose and falls down. She cannot wear them. I was after a looser top because the others cut into her leg and stop circulation. Any suggestions? !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10005	segmentId=10005	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Where do I start.... First of all, the color is definitely baby pink, not the taupe-ish dusty rose color that is pictured. Second, I would never consider this a wrap dress, I would say it’s a glorified kimono. Third, it’s completely see through and fourth, the boob area was way too baggy so unless you’re EXTRA blessed in the chest department this might just look like a saggy cheap robe. In spite of the high hopes I had for this “dress”, I’d have to say it’s a big thumbs down for me unfortunately. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10006	segmentId=10006	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Awful. Looks cheap. He didnt care of course. He liked it. But I prefer to wear things that look and feel of quality. It also runs large. Overall, waste of $$ !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10007	segmentId=10007	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Cheap, Easy Tear. Very cheap material, ripped almost instantly when wearing and putting hands in pocket. Would not recommend. !#nexlpEOL#!

Once I receive the return label, the words on the label are very small. Overall the customer service is poor !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10009	segmentId=10009	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Skip this one. Poorly made. Looks really cut in the picture but the padding is weird and the poor excuse for underwire was already coming out when I opened the box. You get what you pay for with this one. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10010	segmentId=10010	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Way too big. I ordered a size down since I like the bands to feel snug and secure, but it was wayyyy too big. I cant even wear them because they slide down or roll up. Its unfortunate because I was so excited to order them! The material on the band also is not sticky enough to adhere to the pants. Wish I would've returned when I had the chance. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10011	segmentId=10011	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!I bought the dress in a size medium, but .... I bought the dress in a size medium, but it was way too big. The waist needed to be taken in a few inches. If it was smaller in the waist area, I think it would have had a more flattering appearance. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10012	segmentId=10012	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Don’t waste your time. I will be sending this item back. I bought the 2XL after reading reviews and the cups on the top are smaller than a training bra and I can’t get the top to clasps at all. I’m a 36 C and there is absolutely no way this would fit. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10013	segmentId=10013	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Sizes aren’t accurate.. Newborn size is far too big to be a newborn size. I ordered size newborn but when it arrived the tag says 0-3 mo, and it’s much bigger than my other 0-3 month clothes, it’s closer to a 3-6 month onesie. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10014	segmentId=10014	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Never received.. Never got the product. They offered a full refund for it. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10015	segmentId=10015	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Fabric. Fabric was pure polyester, not good for infants. I wouldn't have bought it if I had known. !#nexlpEOL#!

threadId=10018	segmentId=10018	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Difficult to get in and out of it. Too .... Difficult to get in and out of it. Too many handles and the zipper ids way smaller than the purse. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10019	segmentId=10019	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Very cute but doesn’t stay on!. All of the belts are very cute but once you start moving around while wearing them they come open and fall off. The links on the black belt completely fell off the belt. :( !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10020	segmentId=10020	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Don't buy it from these guys. Do not buy this item from this company. The item came without the proper cuts in the wristband, and when I actually tried to fix it the material just turned to crap. One star is too high but had to mark it with one !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10021	segmentId=10021	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Unfortunately. If you have bigger boobs all it’s going to do is give your boobs creepy wrinkly looking mess !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10022	segmentId=10022	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Order one size larger than you think you are. It’s very short - not nearly as long as pictured. Does not fit as it should - improper sizing on vendor’s part. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10023	segmentId=10023	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Not impressed. They just fit awkward and looked weird !#nexlpEOL#!

threadId=10027	segmentId=10027	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Huge. i wear medium so i order medium but wayyyyy to big so i just decided to give it away n order small size instead but unfortunately it looks like an extra large just waaaayyy too big !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10028	segmentId=10028	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Very small. This hat is kid sized. Had to give it away to a child. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10029	segmentId=10029	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Avoid. Material held o to wrinkles easily. Somehow washed it and aquired some type of clear stain I couldn’t get rid of. None of my other whites had this weird stain? Needless to say it’s in the garbage now. !#nexlpEOL#!

threadId=10032	segmentId=10032	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!It was send in an amazon box that would've packaged all of it nicely, but instead was rolled up in another package .... I'm giving this only one star mainly for how it was shipped! It was send in an amazon box that would've packaged all of it nicely, but instead was rolled up in another package & then put in the box! The hat has a crease right in the front that we can't get out, & leaves it looking more like Peter Pan's hat! If I had for time, I would've sent it back, but now I'm trying to use an iron to get that crease out. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10033	segmentId=10033	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Nope. Nope. Nope.. It’s didn’t fit at all like this picture. It was horrible !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10034	segmentId=10034	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Perfect wallet... If you're a minimalist.. Credit cards stick out too far, and there's little room for any extra membership/rewards cards. Magnet is weak; wouldn't trust it with more than a few singles. You really have to force the cards in for some of the slots. I was really hoping I could replace my beat up wallet with this, but it's nothing like I was hoping and I'll probably just toss it out and keep using my old wallet. If you have 4 cards and an ID, sure, it might be sufficient. But for the rest of us in the real world, this thing is a waste of money. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10035	segmentId=10035	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Cheaply made, quickly falls apart. It's warm, I like the design, but after a couple of washes the pocket stitching is falling apart. This is a VERY cheaply made product and lasts about a month before it starts falling apart. !#nexlpEOL#!

threadId=10038	segmentId=10038	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!disappointed. Sent it back. Was disappointed. Did not like material and collar was weird and so was fit of belt and bust was lower than i expected. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10039	segmentId=10039	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Cute, but too little. Order a two sizes up. I ordered a medium and I normally wear a small.. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10040	segmentId=10040	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Sadly disappointed. I was very excited when I first got them! Then I held them up to the light and realized I could see through them completely. Then when I went to try them on, there was no stretch. If I stood completely still, they fit perfect, but I could walk in them without them moving down my hips. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10041	segmentId=10041	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!???. I've had this USB drive for about four months. I reformatted it to use for different data, and it only gave me 56 GB. Formatting again didn't help. Disappointed. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10042	segmentId=10042	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!NOT leather !. it is NOT leather, it's just plastic and has a weird smell too ! I was easily able to scratch off the "leather" off of it with my fingernail ! !#nexlpEOL#!

threadId=10044	segmentId=10044	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Loose around waist and neck. Also hole. There’s a hole in the sleeve and the turtle neck was awkwardly loose !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10045	segmentId=10045	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Confusing sizing.. The size chart is way off. Not sure if anyone is monitoring the 'Size Chart' link vs. the sizes offered for selection. I selected an XXL because the size chart says an XL is a US size 8. I needed a US size 10 or 12. Well, the shirt is exactly what you would expect a typical XXL might be. It's very confusing as I've ordered some of these Chinese made shirts before. Sizing is all over the map -- sometimes they follow the size chart and sometimes they are the actual letter size. Makes it very difficult to guess which one it might be. Wanted a few new tops for my niece and of the 6 Chinese-made tops I ordered, only one fit. It's a waste of time to wait for them and then to have to send them back due to this type of error. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10046	segmentId=10046	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Two Stars. Fits pretty small and the fabric is not the quality I expected. !#nexlpEOL#!

They’re comfortable as far as thongs go- I prefer g strings wanted to try thongs. Front pouch coverage deceiving cuz the only photo with a model allegedly wearing one shows a much narrower front pouch- I like minimal coverage I wouldn’t have bought these if I saw there was so much fabric in front. That being said, I like the waistband sides are like string bikini and tail is comfortable would’ve gave it 5 stars if front was narrow like the 1 photo of model allegedly wearing it !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10048	segmentId=10048	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Runs small. This was very cheaply made. Very thin material, not at all as cozy as my other carrier hoodie. Big gap around where baby’s head comes out so it’s not very warm. !#nexlpEOL#!

threadId=10051	segmentId=10051	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Good fit. More buttons which add shine to the jacket than I thought. In the picture the jacket looks clean but in reality...too many brings (something which I personally don't like) !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10052	segmentId=10052	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Poor quality, way too small.. I bought this hoping it would be more like the Wrangler Riggs work jacket. Sadly, it was of significantly poorer quality, had only buttons rather than a zipper front, the hood fabric was very thin, and the size (I ordered a 2x) was way too small, more like a Large, with very short sleeves. I returned the jacket. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10053	segmentId=10053	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!I did not receive all my socks. I dislike the fact I have only received 5 pair of socks vice the 7 I paid for with this transaction. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10054	segmentId=10054	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Meh. I want to love this shirt I really do... When I first got it had a very strong odor to it. So I decided to wash it before using it on my son for his 2nd birthday party. After washing it there were several cracks in the truck where green fabric show through. I'm still going to use it because it's only for one day however for the $15 I paid I expected it to make it at least a few washes... Oh well it's still cute and the truck made my guy happy !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10055	segmentId=10055	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Color fades quickly. The trunks are fine when new. However, within 4 months of normal use (I swim 2-3 times a week at a pool), my black trunks have faded into a strange green color. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10056	segmentId=10056	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Careful washing!!. I really like this sweatshirt. It fits well and is very soft. I’ve had it for a few months and always wash and try it on normal cycles with no problems. Until I accidentally wash and dried it inside out. The lettering fused together and rips when I try to separate it. So after a few wears it’s completely ruined. 😔 I’m so bummed. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10057	segmentId=10057	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!I hope it was a mistake because the fabric it self was good and it fit great. I send it back, the ped was stiched in the worng place. I hope it was a mistake because the fabric it self was good and it fit great. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10058	segmentId=10058	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Thin material. The material isn’t that good it still shows off every dent nook and cranny even if you wear another dress over it. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10059	segmentId=10059	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!so it's hard to wear them like you're supposed to without messing up your hair. These are very soft and cute but they're kind of tight and the bridge does not extend enough, so it's hard to wear them like you're supposed to without messing up your hair, but if you have a small head these would be perfect! !#nexlpEOL#!

threadId=10062	segmentId=10062	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Runs big, really big. I purchased this in a small and it's massive. Even after washing and drying it trying to shrink it it's still too big. I gave it to my friend who normally wears size medium and it was even too big for him. The quality seems fine otherwise. It smelled strongly of chemicals when removed from the package. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10063	segmentId=10063	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Run very small. They run small at least one-two sizes smaller. Ordered a 36 waist. More like a 32. Sadly will have to return them !#nexlpEOL#!

threadId=10065	segmentId=10065	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Two Stars. Cute, wears well but very thin material. See through as well. Dress ripped after one time wearing it. !#nexlpEOL#!

threadId=10067	segmentId=10067	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Cheap material.. Nice cut...nice style...skimped on material quality. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10068	segmentId=10068	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Not as pictured. I always wear a medium so I got a large. The fit was fine but it looked nothing like the picture. The back was not as long as pictured and the “black” was more of a dark gray. It was also extremely see through. I returned it immediately. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10069	segmentId=10069	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Too bulky. Too bulky to wear under work out clothes. Kinda defeats the purpose. !#nexlpEOL#!

threadId=10071	segmentId=10071	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!2 stars. Run super small. 6 to 9 months can probably fit a newborn !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10072	segmentId=10072	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!I would not order this product. I think this bathing suit was made for a size 3 person. I ordered an extra large thinking OK this will fit , no way it did not fit !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10073	segmentId=10073	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Weird fit. Holy cow, this hat is small. And deep! I normally wear kids size hats on my small head and this one was tight. Also, the depth of the hat is weirdly large. If you pull it down even remotely close to having the top near your head, it's down past your eyes. Really weird fit. Sent it back. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10074	segmentId=10074	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Disappointed. I really wanted to like this hat but the bill is very long and though description says unisex, it is not very flattering on a woman (in my opinion). !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10075	segmentId=10075	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Four Stars. super cute and adjustable. now to see if they will hold up and work well in montana. !#nexlpEOL#!

threadId=10077	segmentId=10077	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Great tote purse. This looks just as pictured, very cute design and very spacious. The only problem I had was the straps kept coming off but once I tightened them they’re good to go! !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10078	segmentId=10078	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!As described but the delivery took so much longer. The product seems good fabric, but the delivery took so much longer. It didn't fit me well, was too large. But I'll use it to sleep, so it's not that problem. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10079	segmentId=10079	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Comfortable leggings. Very nice, soft leggings in exactly the color I wanted...only 4 stars ‘cause even though the fabric is not see through, it’s fairly thin and only good for layering in very cold weather. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10080	segmentId=10080	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Read the description!!!!!!. It's soft and very comfortable. I didn't read the description well enough to see there is glitter on the shirt and it's a printed graphic not actual lace. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10081	segmentId=10081	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Four Stars. it was fairly comfortable. worth purchase .... !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10082	segmentId=10082	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Fits well. It fits well for post partum belly !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10083	segmentId=10083	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!belts. The belts are actually a brilliant idea. Not a 5 because the buckle is not as nice as others I've seen. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10084	segmentId=10084	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Adorable, but runs a little small...get the next size up.. So cute! Bought a large as a gift for my mother-in-law, and she loved it.

My only complaint is that you can’t adjust the collar stay very easily as I thought. It takes some time getting used to but all in all good purchase. I like how the item can fit all the collar stay sizes. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10087	segmentId=10087	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Four Stars. Nice pants but, way to be big!! !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10088	segmentId=10088	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Very comfortable and nice looking. I really liked the look of these denim looking blue jean leggings. They are very comfortable too. The only suggestion is put a little tummy control at the top. Even without the tummy control of other leggings I have, I ordered a pair of these leggings in black and they are just as nice. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10089	segmentId=10089	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Nice summer suit. I love this bathing suit! Only issue is that the bottoms are somewhat sheer out of the water, but otherwise I like this! !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10090	segmentId=10090	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Love the shirt. Love the shirt! My only complaint is that I wish the arms were a bit longer. I should mention that have very long arms and this is my usual complaint. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10091	segmentId=10091	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Ok I'm feeling these!. Just got my joggers, style is great and fit. I can work out in them and style around in them as wearing them as casual wear. As someone who works out comfort and style is a must, not to mention a good price point. I just found my perfect athletic wear from top to bottom. I plan on getting the matching jacket next. I highly recommend their wears to any guy (thumbs up!). !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10092	segmentId=10092	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!HOT HOT HOT (Literally). Super cute dress! I absolutely loved it, fit as it should. My only complaint is the material, it's a fuzzy spandex body suit, it's a hot box! If you're body temperature is higher in your pregnancy, purchase at your own risk. I'm not generally a warm person and I sweat through this dress in an hour. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10093	segmentId=10093	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Best socks if you stand for long hours. I purchased them for my husband because he was complaining of heel pain when exercises and want not too tight socks around the ankle. They came earlier than what they state. They are made of nice material that make soft compression on on your heels and not too tight. They mentioned it should be hand wash but I washed them many many time in gentle cycle and yep they still doing the same work. I just wish if they could make it with other different colors to match out fit. I made another purchase but for me this time. I like to wear them when I work at home as well at the park when I go to play with my kids !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10094	segmentId=10094	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!What I ordered. Fits as expected, but rides up sometimes which is annoying. Fabric quality as expected. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10095	segmentId=10095	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Cute suit!. Cute suit! Love the ruffle and when it goes up while swimming you still have coverage from the high waisted bottom. Ordered a second one in a different color combo !#nexlpEOL#!

threadId=10098	segmentId=10098	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Cute but not a lot of support. This is a cute swimsuit, but the top offers deceptively little coverage and tends to slip down when I'm moving around. Luckily, you can tighten the straps, so that does help a bit with that problem. Still, I would not recommend this swimsuit for anything who wears larger than a C cup. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10099	segmentId=10099	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Love it. Absolutely love this set!! Super pretty without being overdone, only wish the bra straps were adjustable! I’m 5’5” and 130 lbs for reference !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10100	segmentId=10100	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Good for long dresses and easy to store.. These were very adorable and though the one for the older kids was kind of small in length, it still made her dress pop!! !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10101	segmentId=10101	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Love it. Both for myself as a gift. Can’t beat the price !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10102	segmentId=10102	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Super cute!. Really cute! Ordered it for a toddler, fit perfect. Does come folded so takes a while to flatten. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10103	segmentId=10103	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Soft, keeps you warm but not for outdoors. I was looking for something to keep me warm and soft, lately I have anxiety thinking of going to ross/marshalls/tjmaxx to go through all the racks and try to find a hoodie or etc. and try them all in dressing rooms only to find out it is too big or small! Anyways thats why I ordered this from amazon, the thing is I really liked it but I wish it was a bit thick and keeps you more warm but overall I liked it. I am gonna wear in the house and maybe while sleeping now in LA it is getting cold at nights. But if you are looking for something to wear outdoors and keep you warm this is not the product for you,and pockets have a weird fabric inside like polyester which I do not like. And hand wash only which is a problem for me we will see how it goes 😀 !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10104	segmentId=10104	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Good product at a good price. Fits and looks nice . Many color choices . No advertising on hat , comfortable sizing strap . !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10105	segmentId=10105	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Looked nice just little tighter for my liking.. Not as loose fitting as I was suspecting. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10106	segmentId=10106	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!For smaller builds. This is made out of quality material. The Velcro is strong and the brace forces your shoulders back without pinching or discomfort. It is a smaller brace though and not one size fits all. It fits a child or someone with a small build the best. My 12 year old brother is using it and it fits well. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10107	segmentId=10107	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Perfect fit. Love my new jeans... definatly found my new place ! They fit great! !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10108	segmentId=10108	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!They are short. The arms on these are shorter than any other readers I have bought. Seem to be sized more for women than men. They look good, but don't fit that well for a man. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10109	segmentId=10109	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Okay. They are cute, but the fit is just okay. Keep slipping off the back of my heel. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10110	segmentId=10110	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Four Stars. Super soft and a great fit. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10111	segmentId=10111	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Loved this dress. Loved this dress! Very comfy and fits great! Material is a little thin but not see through. I bought a large, in the navy blue. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10112	segmentId=10112	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!(~);}. Great design. Comfy fabric !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10113	segmentId=10113	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Love them! Bought every color.. Love it! Truth be told, I find regular bras annoying to wear so practically live in sports bras. These caught my eye as providing my cleavage a bit of a boost as well as having a more...attractive look than your typical sports bra. Would I wear it on a jog? No, I really don't think it would provide me comfortable support. But for everyday wear and light activity? Absolutely no complaints. Matter of fact, after buying the black as a test run, I ended up buying every color. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10114	segmentId=10114	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Protects from the sun and looks sexy!. Awesome. Easy to get in and out of. Well constructed with durable fabric. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10115	segmentId=10115	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!AMAZING. LOVE THESE!!! they fit so well and my ginormous 5 month old will be able to wear them for a bit longer!!!! seriously the best purchase !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10116	segmentId=10116	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Five Stars. This top is adorable !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10117	segmentId=10117	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Standard T-shirt. Fits as expected. No complaints. 😊 !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10118	segmentId=10118	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Living legend since 1958 T Shirt. I bought this for my husband’s 60th birthday he put on on for his birthday party and again two days later. He loved it. It did well when it was washed. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10119	segmentId=10119	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Great for big sunglasses. I need something to hold my new prescription glasses - I wanted to protect my Coach glasses and this was perfect. Double protection and great to toss in beach bag !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10120	segmentId=10120	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!It runs a bit small, but is still okay.. I like the softness and length. It is also light but not too thin. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10121	segmentId=10121	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Super comfortable and cute. I have a hard time with off shoulder shirts sometimes, it seems like they want to ride up onto my shoulders. This shirt didn’t do that at all, it stayed exactly where it should be. I even danced in it. I love the sleeve accents and the lace, the shirt makes me feel very pretty. I adore it. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10122	segmentId=10122	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Feeling sexy. Love it can be used for any special occasion or just want to feel sexy !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10123	segmentId=10123	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Worth it!!!. The fabric material of this shirt is soft and flowy and the color doesnt fade when washed but the size does run small and its snug from the chest area so i would suggest ordering 1 size larger than what you usually wear. I personally really liked the ribbon tie that came with it... You can style it in different ways as you can see in the pictures attached. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10124	segmentId=10124	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Five Stars. Very warm and fit great !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10125	segmentId=10125	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!You won’t be disappointed! Very cute.. Good quality, you won’t be disappointed! !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10126	segmentId=10126	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Good but they sent me a dirty one. I love these bras- BUT i received a black one with white deodorant marks on the pits! So that was a little startling! Sent it back and re ordered another. I hope i don't get the deodorant one again! !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10127	segmentId=10127	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Socks Stay Put!. I really like these socks and have purchased several sets over the past few months. While I ordered the ones pictured, I did not receive the colors I thought I had ordered (as noted by other buyers). That is ok and I will not deduct a point for that, as it is not the seller that I am rating. The socks stay put, are comfortable, and look absolutely adorable with boots. Great product. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10128	segmentId=10128	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Five Stars. Great product. Arrived quickly, works as advertised. !#nexlpEOL#!

threadId=10132	segmentId=10132	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Best shorts everrrrrr!. I got these in white. I just hiked in them. I’m 8 months pregnant and they form fit right to me without being too tight on the baby which is very important! I can also tell that they will easily fit me when I’m not pregnant. I’m 5’7, 170 lbs. normally am 145-150 when not pregnant. The white isn’t see through at all. Material is thick. And so so comfy! I WILL order this in other colors and maybe double up on the white pair! !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10133	segmentId=10133	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Great buy. The price and quality very good !#nexlpEOL#!

I'm about a 12/14 and go L or XL - this was an XL and it was perfect and even looks cute. The fabric is a little heavier weight so I can actually show myself to houseguests without feeling naked. I'll order a couple more!! !#nexlpEOL#!
