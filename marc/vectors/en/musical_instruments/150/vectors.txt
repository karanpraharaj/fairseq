threadId=10000	segmentId=10000	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Disappointed in the lights. Bought two of these lights and they seemed to work when tested. I mean they turned on and responded to sound as was expected. During an event ( first use) these lights had problems and did not respond to the remote and the buttons in the back. Also could not get the lights to work with the DMX and could not be slaved. Fussed with the light trying everything possible but had no success. Very disappointed as I was very excited for these lights. Luckily we had bought and brought other par lights from other brands that we used with no issues. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10001	segmentId=10001	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Does that sound or feel like a guitar. I did not like the fact that it doesn't resemble the feel of a real guitar. I thought I was going to be to be able to practice playing on the go, but this was not the case. If you're looking for a practice tool to help you learn where to put your fingers I guess this would work. If you're looking for anything more than that this is not what you're looking for !#nexlpEOL#!

threadId=10024	segmentId=10024	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!No Manual. As one reviewer noted, this is a solidly built unit. Beyond that, however, its functions seem to be very limited, at within Cubase. It mostly just duplicates everything that my number pad already did. The fader won't write automation, which is the main reason you would want a physical fader in Cubase or any other DAW. It may have hidden functions that I haven't yet discovered (I hope), but I have no way of determining what those functions might be because it doesn't come with a manual. I mean seriously, NO MANUAL. !#nexlpEOL#!

threadId=10060	segmentId=10060	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Not suitable for acoustic guitar - cigar box only. If installing on an acoustic guitar where you must follow the curve of the body, you'll be forced to install the box upside down, which may be a bit frustrating for the player. But even worse than that - the pickup is 1/8th inch thick. This means you either must route the saddle groove that much deeper, or sand 1/8th evenly off the saddle bottom or "enjoy" your action (string height) 1/8th inch higher! !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10061	segmentId=10061	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!2 stars because it does play, kinda.. I ignored the other reviews for this product in favor of its lower price. That was a mistake.

threadId=10070	segmentId=10070	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Excellent sound, atrocious build quality.. These headphones sound absolutely amazing. Better than anything I've ever heard. Supposedly, they are the best closed back headphones you can get at this price range. And I am inclined to believe that. They come with a leather (possibly real) carrying bag, a comically long straight cord, and an annoyingly sized spiral cord. The spiral cord went down to my knees with my music player in my pocket, making it not ideal for commuting. I purchased a much shorter cord for my commute for around $10. Very impressed overall. However, these broke on me after 3 and a half months of use. I took them off and SNAP, a piece of the hinge on my left side snapped, leaving wires exposed and the headphones unwearable (they still work). Throughout my ownership of these cans, whenever I moved the ear cups, there was a cracking sound, like the plastic was screaming for help. I thought that this was just an odd feature, but I now believe it to be a design or manufacturing flaw. I am unsure if Audio Technica and/or Amazon would cover this under a warranty or not. I do not have the budget to pay them to fix it, buy new headphones, or waste money shipping the headphones back and forth to possibly get a free repair done. So, I will probably have to do a crappy epoxy or tape job to fix these, as I absolutely cannot stand to listen to dollar store ear buds anymore. I bought these headphones not only because of the sound, but because I was led to believe that these were extremely durable headphones that would last me years to come. That is perfect, because I used these on my daily commute, brought them camping, took them halfway across the US with me, and I used them for practicing my instruments. But alas, they did not last, so I cannot recommend these headphones with their current build quality, unless you are to only use them at your desk. And at that point, you might as well buy more expensive, better sounding headphones (not that these sound bad, because they don't). I am impressed, but at the same time thoroughly disappointed in this product. I cannot recommend these to your average consumer. Consume at your own risk. !#nexlpEOL#!

I wasn't expecting much when I made my purchase, but turns out it's actually not that bad; the arm is lightweight but it gets sturdy after you mount it. I did have to tighten the screw at the top with a small wrench to hold the Yeti in position (right now I have it up diagonally). I haven't noticed any drooping but it's only been couple days and I've been moving it around, but overall I'm satisfied with this arm for the Yeti mic! !#nexlpEOL#!

threadId=10098	segmentId=10098	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!yup. works.. Works perfect. Honestly slightly tighter than even I prefer. But it's solid and it makes the keys stay in place. Not going anywhere. Most people think I'm carrying around a flute or something LOL. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10099	segmentId=10099	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Durable. Bag is durable and well padded. It's also big enough for most of my hardware. Some hardware may be too big for the bag without completely disassembling it. It can also get difficult to carry if there's too much in it, or if the sizes of the contents allow the bag to bend. If I upgrade, I will probably go with a longer bag/case with at least one hard side and with wheels. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10100	segmentId=10100	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Four Stars. Very nice sound, material and ukulele decorativo details. Only the tuner didn’t work but everything else is very good. !#nexlpEOL#!

threadId=10111	segmentId=10111	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Telescopic pole VERY difficult to extend at first, but it does extend. I was almost ready to send this stand back during assembly when step 3 said "Extend the telescopic pole to the desired height." The silver telescopic pole would not budge no matter how hard I tried to pull it up, so I thought it was defective. However, I thought I'd have my husband try it before completely giving up. He couldn't budge it at first either, but then he stepped on the base with both feet while pulling up on the silver telescopic pole with one of those rubbery gripper things for opening jars. Finally he was able to pull it up. It moves up and down a bit more easily now, but is still extremely tight. (I know you don't want it too loose so it will stay where you put it, but it's tighter than on other similar music stands I used to use when I played in my high school band.) I think that either the pole should not be made so tight, or else the instructions should warn you that you may have to use extreme measures to get it to extend, so that you won't think it's immovable and defective. There is also an error on the first page of the instructions where the parts are identified -- oddly, they identify the picture of the base as the "connector", the picture of the telescopic pole as the "base", and the picture of the connector as the "telescopic pole". Somebody should have proofread the instructions! Once we got the stand assembled, I'm happy with it because I will be using it at a certain height and won't be moving it up and down very often. !#nexlpEOL#!

The kids absolutely loved feeling like stars. It's a full size microphone with a speaker box attached. It's good weight and even toddlers could hold it just fine. We use the Bluetooth option and was easy to connect. Has fun lights on the sides that light up. !#nexlpEOL#!

threadId=10116	segmentId=10116	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Satisfactory. I am learning bass guitar and I have the standard Squier by Fender model guitar. I wasnt expecting much from this stand but its compact and seems sturdy and holds the guitar fine.

When I saw these colored mic cords in a set of 6 different colors I knew they would be an excellent addition to my stage setups.

Excellent choice going with the 25’ length too. Great for almost every show. !#nexlpEOL#!
