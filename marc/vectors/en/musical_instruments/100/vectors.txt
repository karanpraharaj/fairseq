threadId=200572	segmentId=200572	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Disappointed in the lights. Bought two of these lights and they seemed to work when tested. I mean they turned on and responded to sound as was expected. During an event ( first use) these lights had problems and did not respond to the remote and the buttons in the back. Also could not get the lights to work with the DMX and could not be slaved. Fussed with the light trying everything possible but had no success. Very disappointed as I was very excited for these lights. Luckily we had bought and brought other par lights from other brands that we used with no issues. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=200844	segmentId=200844	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Does that sound or feel like a guitar. I did not like the fact that it doesn't resemble the feel of a real guitar. I thought I was going to be to be able to practice playing on the go, but this was not the case. If you're looking for a practice tool to help you learn where to put your fingers I guess this would work. If you're looking for anything more than that this is not what you're looking for !#nexlpEOL#!

I'm stuck with it. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=201262	segmentId=201262	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Don't waste your money. Absolute piece of junk.

Waste of money. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=201286	segmentId=201286	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Poor. the divits in the stick are so shallow they barely make any sound. Poor product !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=201429	segmentId=201429	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Goes off and on and is hard to use. I used this on an acoustic guitar and the day I got it it was hard to set it up so it would tune. It keep going light and then dark thought the battery was bad so changed it and problem was the same. Never did get to tune my guitar right . I would not recommend this tuner there are better ones available . !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=201595	segmentId=201595	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Not even close. NOT a G note. Tuner reads it vacillating between E and B and doesn’t even sound good at those notes. One star was generous. !#nexlpEOL#!

threadId=204953	segmentId=204953	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!No Manual. As one reviewer noted, this is a solidly built unit. Beyond that, however, its functions seem to be very limited, at within Cubase. It mostly just duplicates everything that my number pad already did. The fader won't write automation, which is the main reason you would want a physical fader in Cubase or any other DAW. It may have hidden functions that I haven't yet discovered (I hope), but I have no way of determining what those functions might be because it doesn't come with a manual. I mean seriously, NO MANUAL. !#nexlpEOL#!

threadId=240433	segmentId=240433	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Ok. I’ll give two stars because they aren’t toys. It’s nice to find the key but they sound bad. A lot of bad holes and feels flimsy. I’m comparing to Marine Bands so for a beginner or just a hobby player these would probably be great. But not really for a show or recording. !#nexlpEOL#!

threadId=244374	segmentId=244374	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Not suitable for acoustic guitar - cigar box only. If installing on an acoustic guitar where you must follow the curve of the body, you'll be forced to install the box upside down, which may be a bit frustrating for the player. But even worse than that - the pickup is 1/8th inch thick. This means you either must route the saddle groove that much deeper, or sand 1/8th evenly off the saddle bottom or "enjoy" your action (string height) 1/8th inch higher! !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=244727	segmentId=244727	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!2 stars because it does play, kinda.. I ignored the other reviews for this product in favor of its lower price. That was a mistake.

threadId=245010	segmentId=245010	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Waste of money. Cuts out when using. Can’t stay on for an entire 30 minutes. Sounds good for maybe 15 minutes before it goes out and you have to mess with it to get it going again. !#nexlpEOL#!

I wasn't expecting much when I made my purchase, but turns out it's actually not that bad; the arm is lightweight but it gets sturdy after you mount it. I did have to tighten the screw at the top with a small wrench to hold the Yeti in position (right now I have it up diagonally). I haven't noticed any drooping but it's only been couple days and I've been moving it around, but overall I'm satisfied with this arm for the Yeti mic! !#nexlpEOL#!
