threadId=10000	segmentId=10000	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!1 is not good to use. 1 is not good to use.There is no sound insulation.And it's very expensive.It still doesn't work if you try to place a different position. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10001	segmentId=10001	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Horrible quality - do not buy. This thing was soo cheaply made. Horrible quality. It broke as we were putting the pieces together. I do not recommend buying this product at all. Waste of money. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10002	segmentId=10002	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!One Star. Half the keys didn't work and we're lodged so they didn't even depress. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10003	segmentId=10003	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Not worth it. Jewels fall off alot. Had jewels off when arriving. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10004	segmentId=10004	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!If your buying this for music class at school, Don’t!. My son needed a ukulele for music class, this ukulele is more of a play toy. The strings are plastic and one string immediately broke after opening it. We returned this and had to buy the more expensive one.. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10005	segmentId=10005	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Hard to hold. The idea is good, gives a softer sound than plastic pick which can be harsh on a ukulele... but I find the felt is difficult to grip and slides out of my fingers while playing.. still prefer my thumb best but oh the blisters after a rockin’ out a few tunes! !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10006	segmentId=10006	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Doesnt really work.. Left ear is way lower in volume than the right ear. Cant really do much with the unbalance. They look nice but looks dont help function. :-/ !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10007	segmentId=10007	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!They broke after my 3rd use. I don't play .... They broke after my 3rd use. I don't play hard, at least I don't think so. Even so, my kit is mic'ed. I have no need to play hard. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10008	segmentId=10008	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Great tuner, But.... Fantastic small tuner with adjustable frequency option. Only a two star rating because it displays a flashing "A" In the sharp position for the b-string, that problem began two weeks after the delivery. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10009	segmentId=10009	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Nice product. You get what you pay for !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10010	segmentId=10010	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Really cute amp. This mini amp is super cute looks just like the picture but it's plastic guys (you know what, whatever it's cute anyway) !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10011	segmentId=10011	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Four Stars. They work great! sound great.. I should've paid attention to the sizes.. the tiny one is TINY!!!!! !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10012	segmentId=10012	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Fun for little kids. Not bad 4yr old son likes it... not very high quality! !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10013	segmentId=10013	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!GREAT VALUE. I have used this new Bluetooth earbud for a few weeks now, and here are my likes and dislikes. . . LIKES: 1) fits well in my ear and doesn't fall out. Set it and forget it. It only has one button, and if it is set correctly I have no trouble accessing the button (to end or answer a call). 2) Battery seems to last a long time... put it this way...I have not had the battery die on me yet after numerous calls during a day. 3) The charging method is clever. . . just plug in the USB base, and the earbud has a magnet that grabs it out of your hand for a perfect connection every time. You can find in it dark easily! 4) The speaker is very clear and un-distorted....I'd say the best I've ever had. 5) It has a seemingly long range... longer than others I've had. DISLIKES: 1) I do not like the voice. Why not use the old AT&T woman's voice? This woman speaks the commands clearly, but I just don't like it. Sounds like an old girlfriend. 2) When you walk too far from your phone, it doesn't warn you. . . it just disconnects. You have to turn it back on to reconnect. 3) If you don't use it for awhile, it will turn itself off. I guess that is a good thing? I just have never turned them off until I'm done for the day. 4) Occasionally, and always when you are trying to connect a call..... it will just not work correctly. The phone may show you are connected, but the device is not connected and NOT working. I guess it could be my phone.....I am just not sure. All in all, these are VERY minor complaints, compared to everything this device does so well. I highly recommend! !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10014	segmentId=10014	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Thanks to a second set of strings!. 1 string broke! Product came with a second set so after replacing it which took some time was great! Good for kids! So affordable and nice size! Tuner is nice. Turns green when in tune! This product would have got 5 stars had the 1st string not broken! !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10015	segmentId=10015	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!nice set of strings. nice set of strings. Didn't fit like I expected a short scale set to fit but I didn't measure them before I cut them to fit without excess. still a good buy. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10016	segmentId=10016	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!What I expected.. Exactly what I expected. They do the job. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10017	segmentId=10017	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Great device.. Not a fan of the headphones, but interface is solid. Very low noise and software to adjust settings is simple enough. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10018	segmentId=10018	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Great value, perfect stand for my laptop.... This tripod worked out perfect for my 15-inch laptop. I didn’t have any place for the mouse pad or power supply thou. I found another seller that has selves that clamp onto the OD of the tripod, problem solved! The tripod is sturdy and isn’t expensive either. I’d recommend it to anyone. !#nexlpEOL#!
