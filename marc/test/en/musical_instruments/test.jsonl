{"id": "10001", "label": "0", "text": "Fell apart in shipping- screwed up my gig. REALLY needed this, so ordered two weeks ahead of needing it to take my PA to a friend's house for a party. Well, the packaging came apart and I kept getting notices that delivery was rescheduled. Only after many days was I able to determine that they just returned what's left to Amazon and cancelled the sale. ?? Why they wouldn't dispatch another one is beyond me, so I had to stack amps and EQ's on a table and buy some rubber feet to put between them so they didn't slide around. Real professional looking to have $6K in gear stacked on a table. So, it may be ok if you get one- but chances are you won't, or at least you won't get all of it like SO many reviews state. Just don't bother until Amazon realizes these need to be boxed properly. "}

{"id": "10005", "label": "0", "text": "Terrible audio feedback. I bought this little mixer to, well, mix two audio channels to one output and have the option for a convenient headphone port on my desk. When I first hooked everything up, I had serious issues with an audio feedback buzzing constantly. I did some poking around and thought it was the cheap audio cables I purchased. I bought a whole new set of shielded cables to try and correct the problem. It is no longer constant, but frequently pops up when I power it on. You can work around it by replugging in the cables and eventually it will go away. But this is only true while the input 1 and input 2 levels are at the same volume. If you adjust them the feedback gets worse the further they are apart, if you have one at max and one at min - the feedback is so bad it drowns out the audio. I gave it two stars because it technically works, but a simple 2 into 1 audio connection would do the same thing and save you $30. I would not recommend this to anybody and eventually it will go in the trash. "}

{"id": "10015", "label": "1", "text": "Cool concept! Just needs some more improvements to make it a really awesome product. Really cool concept when it comes to karaoke-ing. I love karaoke so this mic immediately piqued my interests. I think the overall design is good - the rose gold is a nice touch. It's also a standard design that I've been seeing on all other options related to this kind of microphone. For the uninitiated, the way this works is it simultaneously acts as 1) a personal microphone 2) a music streamer / speaker and 3) a voice recorder. Altogether, you have a 3-in-1 device that amplifies your voices and music and records everything that comes out. There's no music in the mic itself though. It has a bluetooth connector so you sync it to your phone and download a karaoke app that can send the karaoke songs to the mic. Or you can even sync your Spotify app. Note that the mic doesn't work with every app unfortunately. The mic comes with different options to adjust the volume level of the music and your voice (separately too!) and even has an option to adjust the level of echo so you actually sound like you're in a karaoke room. Some things I would like to see future improvements on are: 1) there's some annoying feedback that doesn't seem to go away regardless of how far I distance my phone from the mic. If you've figured this out, I'd love to know! 2) the option switches at the middle of the mic is clunky. I'm a sucker for minimalism so it be great if future products can make the design sleeker. 3) support for more karaoke apps Finally, because the sound comes out of this mic directly, and not through a flatscreen or central living room speaker system, it's not as fun in a party setting. If the manufacturer can somehow integrate this into a larger party karaoke ecosystem, that would make this infinity more enjoyable. "}
