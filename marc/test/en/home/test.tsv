10000	One Star. I did not receive this item. 	0
10001	This does not stick well or weed well!. The clear backing lacks the stickiness to keep the letters adhered until you‚Äôre finished weeding! It‚Äôs so frustrating to have to keep up with a bunch of letters and pieces that have curled and fell off the paper! It requires additional work to make sure that they‚Äôre aligned properly and being applied on the right side, which was an issue for me several times! I purchased 3 packs of this and while it‚Äôs okay for larger designs, it sucks for lettering or anything intricate üòè Possibly it‚Äôs old and dried out, but in any event, I will not be buying from this vendor again and suggest that you don‚Äôt either! 	0
10002	One Star. Very disappointed in the quality, patterns and size I will donate or give away. Very unhappy. 	0
10003	One Star. Added so much to the projects! Works well. 	0

10005	Disappointed this was a Birthday gift. The dragon was missing paint and there was glue or something all over the dragon. 	0
10006	Disappointed. SUPER disappointed. The metal is thin, flimsy, bent and unstable. 	0
10007	One Star. broke the first time I used it. 	0
10008	Needs a more powerful fan. Doesn't distribute the steam strong enough small fan but it is quiet but who cares 	0
10009	Don't buy. Did not stick to the wall at all, a lot of it was ripped and it wasn't as full as pictured. I wish I could get my money back but the only way to find out how bad this product is was to use it. Super disappointed, I would not recommend this at all. 	0
10010	Never received item. I never received this item. 	0
10011	Worthless. Absolutely worthless! Adhesive does not stick! 	0
10012	Made cheap. The comforter is super hot but washed the first time and the fabric ripped. Super cheap quality. 	0
10013	This product smells so horrible.. I immediately returned it. You use to have it with a lemon scent which was very pleasant. 	0
10014	Pissed!. I got my package today and it was used it came with dog hair all over it! I am really mad because my house is allergic to dogs! 	0
10015	DISPOSABLE. This wasn't indicated anywhere in the description before I purchased -- these are designed to prevent blade replacement! That makes these far and away the most expensive scalpel blades I've ever bought. 	0
10016	Does not send what you order!. Horrible!!! I ordered 12 sheets received 3. I do not recommend anyone to buy from this seller! It makes you choose a star I would say 0 stars and I will not buy again 	0
10017	It Deflated After 5 uses. It deflated after 5 uses in two months. I asked for a replacement, no one replied. 	0
10018	Brand new and already has hole. Just purchased and wanted these sheets. Put them on a pillow to discover a giant hole in the first pillow case I put on. So disappointed. 	0
10019	Buy if you feel like cleaning fuzz all over your house. I‚Äôm extremely disappointed with this purchase. The amount of pilling on these blankets is unreal. I have blue fuzz all over my house. I‚Äôm surprised there is any blanket left. I followed the washing instructions and both times I have washed them they have come out terribly. I would not buy. 	0
10020	Stay away. One half stopped working after month of use 	0
10021	Malfunctioned within 6 months. We had this in shower area where it only got moisture, no direct water. First the suction kept failing. Then the alarm mysteriously kept going off. Replaced batteries, No improvement. Couldn't turn it off or reset it. Garbage. 	0
10022	Bamboo falls apart & splits. I wish I had taken a picture of the set before I sent it back. But just know that the fork tine split off and the knife had splinters on it that snagged the gauzy bag for storage. The reason I purchased this was to see how the bamboo ones differed. One good thing is that the weight of bamboo is quite a bit less than metal utensils. Couldn't comment on "Easy To Clean" since I didn't actually use it - afraid of splinters! 	0
10023	I tried to set it for over a hour.. I have no idea of this thing works or not. After a hour of tried to just set it to go off, I finally gave up, put in in the box and sent it right back. I read the directions over and over. Sooo confusing. 	0
10024	Jug of window washer arrived without a cap. Jug has only the foil seal on top.. I received my jug of Hope's Perfect Glass Cleaner Refill The jug arrived without a cap, just the foil seal. Love the product, but certainly not the delivery. The product pictures the jug with a black plastic cap. Hope the contents of the jug doesn't spill. What a pain!! 	0
10025	Dont waste your money. Worked great except I only used it maybe 4 times and it just suddenly stopped working, wont do anything now 	0
10026	Do NOT purchase. Very cheap items. They arrived broken and I‚Äôm very disappointed. I planned to do some meal prep this weekend now I have to make other plans. Some of them are actually cracked. 	0
10027	Very disappointed. I ordered this product for a gift, I ordered it on May 16th my mom finally got the product today may 28th and the condition of the products was horrible . The box was not sealed and it was wrapped with lots of plastic. And the pillows were all flat and deflated. I‚Äôm very disappointed. It seemed like the product was to big for the box and it was forced inside of it . 	0
10028	Not very good. My paper towels kept falling off 	0
10029	One Star. It leaves white residue all over dishes! Gross! 	0
10030	Very Disappointed. I love the pillow in the picture but unfortunately, mine does not look like that. The fabric is yellowish, texture looks different and the colors/ink are blotchy and running into the other colors. I uploaded pics but honestly looks worse in person. 	0
10031	Inaccurate information. Not as described. The large sphere is 2in not 20 like advertised. 	0
10032	Very loud and weak. I enjoyed using a previous larger version of this humidifier but this model (1) is small and doesn't output much mist or meaningfully change room humidity according to an indoor humidity gauge and (2) produces very loud water gurgling and bubbling sounds that kept me awake. The older version did not have these issues. 	0
10033	Waste of Money!! ZERO stars. I bought these candle holders for my baby shower and we were unable to use them because the bolts that came with them were too big and the candle holders were too wobbly to use...this purchase was a waste of money! We tried everything, including glue, and nothing worked!! Nothing stabilized these candle holders. 	0
10034	Broke down/rips after 4.5 months. We loved these sheets st first but they have proven to be poor quality with rips at seams and areas of obvious wear from very rare use on our bed. Very disappointed. Would NOT recommend. 	0
10035	One Star. Pillow do not look like picture 	0
10036	Don't buy. Thin curtains that are only good for an accent. 56" wide is if you can stretch to maximum. Minimal light and noise reduction. NOT WORTH THE PRICE!!! 	0
10037	Not what I ordered!!!. This product is not what I ordered and paid for. This was supposed to be a vintage compact mirror (peacock). Highly upset as this was a Christmas gift for my sister!!! 	0
10038	Very dissatisfied. I wanted to be able to use both sides at the same time Very dissatisfied with the product 	0
10039	Not worth the money. Sorry but these are a waist of money. Washed my handy one time and they come right off. I even glued them on because they were so cheep and didn‚Äôt stay when you put the ring on . 	0
10040	Doesn't heat very well. Please do not buy this! I was so excited and I got one for me and my co worker because we freeze in our offices. It's so small and barely even heats up. One of them didn't even work at all! 	0
10041	Bottle leaked in package. It leaked in the envelope it came in and was almost empty, when I opened It. Which I had read on other reviews, but I thought I'd give it a shot. 	0
10042	Not firm enough. This pillow seemed promising for my beck pain based on the 5 star reviews; however, it was not firm enough for me. After requiring a cervical fusion many years ago my neck needs firm support. If this is you, I would not recommend this pillow. 	0
10043	Defective Product. The plastic film is very flimsy. The right side always rips no matter how carefully you peel it. For some weird reason, the left side doesn't have this issue. Definitely not the same quality as the photo albums from years ago. I'm returning this. 	0
10044	Caps missing, several markers dried out.. Ordered these for my daughter as a Christmas present. When she opened the case 3 of the markers did not have the caps on and were completely dried out. She was very disappointed. She then starting testing all of them on a piece of paper, several of them began to run out of ink very quickly. Not happy with this product, tried to return, however these markets are an unreturnable item. 	0
10045	One Star. Returned item. Wouldn‚Äôt work on my faucet 	0
10046	One Star. Poor quality. Would not recommend. 	0
10047	Deceptive marketing. They sent HyClean which is NOT for the US market therefore this is deceptive marketing 	0
10048	Mah. These are mediocre at best. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend, they don‚Äôt look that nice as the picture shows. Looks like a computer print ironed onto a burlap sack. Get what you pay for I guess. It‚Äôs ok I‚Äôll use them for garbage bags 	0
10049	Small!!. This product is very small. The pictures are very deceptive and although I haven‚Äôt used them yet, I‚Äôm beginning to think this was a rip off because the price should be less due to the very small size of these. They‚Äôre only as wide as my pinky finger and as long as my index finger. 	0
10050	Very small. Not a hundred count and very small 	0
10051	Came severely damaged. This arrived bent way out of shape to the point where it doesn‚Äôt sit flat. No hope of actually using it because the cutting boards just slide out of it, because they sit at an angle. 	0
10052	Product does not look like picture. This product is actually just plain, clear squares. Not what the picture looks like at all üòû 	0
10053	Disappointed. The delivery took longer than expected. However, I was going to give it a chance but when I opened the box the item looked beat up, one part was broken and another part and one of the hinges was on the wrong side. 	0
10054	Scam!. Scam, never came in! 	0
10055	Horrible. Absolutely horrible vinyl does not stick at all I even had my heat breast up to 450 and it still wouldn't 	0
10056	One Star. product worked for 30 mins then quit 	0
10057	Never worked. I had high expectations about this product and it was supposed to be a present to my mother. What a disappointment! It never worked, I waisted my money for nothing. 	0
10058	Check out the feet on it. When it arrived and I sat it down on the table it was very unbalanced and the feet on it was uneven. Scared to use thinking it‚Äôs gonna fall over and burn my house down! 	0
10059	It could have better instructions.. Installation instructions are vague and pins are cheap. It gets the job done but I dont feel it will last very long. Cheaply made. Update: lasted 3 months and I didn't even put the max weight on a single line. 	0
10060	Disappointed. I am not impressed at all. No matter how much i fluff it every day I find it to be a very uncomfortable pillow. 	0
10061	Told them to keep money if they needed it that bad... I received this and it was a piece of thin wood with a picture that was glued on crooked and a thin piece of wire.... sent back ( as instructed) and cannot seem to get seller to even answer that they received the return or anything about my credit!!! Told them to keep money if they needed it that bad.... the only reason for the 1 Star is I wouldn‚Äôt be able to let others know about product and seller. 	0
10062	I never received this. I never received this and I was need to go to the store to buy a replacement 	0
10063	Remotes are trash. I bought 2 and both remotes stopped working first 5 min of useing them 	0
10064	Horrible. Not what I expected at all. It's very heavy and uncomfortable. It's like resting my head on a block 	0
10065	Although I love the case. Although I love the case. It is not functional for me. If you turn the case on the side all the oils fall out of place. The purpose of me purchasing this case is so that I could take my oils with me. 	0
10066	It‚Äôs not worth purchasing!. This product should not even be sold on Amazon. It‚Äôs flimsy, cheap and there are no stakes to assemble it properly to set up in yard. 	0
10067	Not Cute !!. This fabric was so disappointing and it looked completely different in person, it's not rose gold and its dull. How can sequins be dull, it's an oxymoron!! 	0
10068	I am unable to use these on any of my .... I am unable to use these on any of my doors! They do not fit. My doors have frames, and the doors in the pictures do not have them. Will never use these. 	0
10069	Beautiful, But Broke When Washing. These are beautiful glasses. We ordered them specifically to drink gin drinks. They are the perfect size and look really classy. We used them a couple of times and hand washed them each time. The third time I hand washed them and the bowl part of one of them totally shattered in my hand while I was drying it. I was really careful with them but still this happened. Such a shame. Really liked them until that happened. I was going to order more but I'm nervous the same thing will happen again. 	0
10070	The description of this product indicated that it would have .... The description of this product indicated that it would have a cosmetic flaw only. This pendant is missing the socket. There is no place to put the light bulb. 	0
10071	Started falling apart in three months. Not good quality. Started falling apart in three months. 	0
10072	Worst purchase ever. Worst purchase ever...bag is way too small cannot hold anything in it First time I opened the bag the bow at front came off in my hands Wasted my money 	0
10073	I got the wrong item. I ordered Copic Bold Primaries and got Copic Ciao Rainbow instead. Amazon gave me a full refund but still annoying to have to reorder and hopefully get the right item. 	0
10074	Piece of trash, faulty water evaporation.. The first night of using this air conditioner it stopped working (in the middle of the night) and the red light went on, indicating that the water tank is full. I removed 3 buckets of water (on the 1st night of operation!). After turning it on, AC stopped working in 1 hour again!!! And I removed 1 bucket of water again!!! So going forward, the AC stopped working every single hour. From what I see this AC has a totally faulty water evaporation system. Don't tell me that the company is not aware of it! This AC should be removed from production and sales and faulty system corrected. For $500 I got myself a trash and a headache, instead of peace and calm and comfortable nights what I was hoping for. If you ever think about this crap, you have been warned. 	0
10075	Not great shipping. Glass was broken had to ship it back waiting on the new one to be here tomorrow hopefully not not broken. 	0
10076	One Star. The width and the depth were opposite of what it said, so they did not fit my cabinet. 	0
10077	Waste of your money if you buy this!!!. It was working fine for the first 3 months after purchased. But after that I need to change battery every month and now it does not dispense any more soap. That is a design flaw where the soap will dry up and block the soap dispense hole. 	0
10078	Not realistic. Very fake looking. I sent back. 	0
10079	It will not work!. It will not turn on. It was a gift and the person called and said it does not work. It won't turn on. I would like to send back and get either another or my money back. 	0
10080	Does not lay flat. Creased beyond usefulness.. I SHOULD HAVE RETURNED THIS PRODUCT BUT THE RETURN WINDOW RAN OUT. The liner comes folded and does not lay flat. I thought that if I left it out, the material would eventually relax and become flat. It has been out a week and it I still all rippled. Why would the manufacturer not ship it in a tube or wrapped around a tube!!!! This liner is useless. What a joke. Do not buy. 	0
10081	Bent my hats. Wasn‚Äôt happy how it bent my hats & also left a line on the bill from the plastic 	0
10082	Leaky. The cover felt soft enough after washing. I followed directions exactly as stated. It leaked the first night and every night since. I am disappointed. It is a good thing that I used a different cover underneath it just in case. 	0
10083	doesn't look like the picture. colors were misleading as well as the texture 	0
10084	Very disappointed.. Not bright enough. Very disappointed. 	0
10085	Door wont close because the bar isnt flat enough. This door hanger is cute and all but its a bit small. My main complain is that, i cannot close my door because the bar latched to the door isnt flat enough.. Worst nightmare. 	0
10086	Does not work. Did not spray a mist; only a stream and no directions provided to try to fix the problem. 	0
10087	To small. So small can't even see it in my garage i though was a lil bigger 	0
10088	Smile amazon has no option to choose when an item is not received.. Never received item and smile amazon has no way on their website to refund orders that were never received. 	0
10089	Disappointed. It was dried out when I opened package. Was very disappointed with this product. 	0
10090	These are no good!. Im not sure if its just this sellers stock of this product or what but the first order was no good, each bottle had mold and clumps in the bottle and usually companies will put a couple of metal beads in a bottle to aid in the mixing but these had a rock in it... like a rock off the ground. I decided to replace the item, same seller, and once again they were all clumpy and gross... I attached a photo. I wouldnt buy these, at least not from this seller. 	0
10091	Mirrors will fall down if you use provided adhesive stickers. Adhesive stickers are completely defective. Mirrors fell off on their own with enough time, and shattered. 	0
10092	Useless in my opinion. Falls of cup therefore does not hold tea bag string 	0
10093	... been a few weeks and it looks moldy & horrible. I bought from the manufacturer last year and .... It's only been a few weeks and it looks moldy & horrible. I bought from the manufacturer last year and had no problems. 	0
10094	SAVE YOUR MONEY. Not flashy at all. One little spot of blue. I feel really ripped off. Now i find out i CANNOT return it!!! I HAVE BEEN RIPPED OFF! 	0
10095	Very unhappy costumer. I recieved a totally different product than I ordered (pictured) and I see that I cannot return it !?! I give them one star just because I'm tryin to be nice. I ordered these black hats for a christmas project that I am doin with my 5 yr old son for his classroom and now I'm afraid to even try to reorder them again in fear that I'll recieve another different product. 	0
10096	One Star. Too big and awkward for your counter 	0
10097	it breaks when opening. Every bags was teared apart when I opened it. I can barely get a fine one to use. 	0
10098	I never got my order!. I'm sure I would have liked it, but I never received it. I waited many months and finally went to Bed Bath and Beyond and bought something else. Never could get any help to get my money back either. I rate this a zero. 	0
10099	THANKS FOR NOTHING UPS!. The one star is for UPS. I wish I had been home when delivery was made because I would have refused it. I have initiated return procedures, so hopefully when seller gets this mess back I will receive my $60 in a timely manner. 	0
10100	Would not recommend this.. I am returning. Very flimsy, could not get top to stay on because the design, shelves did not stay in one place. Would not recommend this. 	0
10101	Camera fail to focusing after couple of months. Camera fail to focus after couple of months. Wife loved that phone and love it more than new Nokia, but we can‚Äôt figure out how to fix it. 	0
10102	Won't buy another one. The LED ring works, but the remainder of the sign is too dark. 	0
10103	Didn‚Äôt get the job done. Sitting in an office all day I needed extra support. The strap on this doesn‚Äôt secure to the chair like you would need in order to use this how you‚Äôd expect to. I had to use a giant rubber band around the top half to keep it from tipping out/forward all the time. 	0
10104	Cheap looking. I see a lot of people have these. They are a cute decoration but pretty cheap. 	0
10105	It's ok.. It's ok. Material quality is great. Seems though that it's not a wide enough material used. My wife is small. 5 foot 3 and about 135 pounds. This barely goes around her. Seems they should add about 3-5 inches of material and it would be perfect. She needs an extra clip on bottom half to avoid any free shows. 	0
10106	Great, but not if you like to sleep in the dark. The device is nicely designed and quiet and seems to do a good job lowering allergen levels in our bedroom. However, it has one really silly design flaw - when plugged in it is always lit with an LED (red when off, blue when running). These lights are much dimmer than the night light they offer, but still much brighter than they should be for one's bedroom. I tape over the light, but it is impossible to block it out completely without also interfering with the air flow. Too bad! 	0
10107	Not worth buying. Very displeased with the porduct.. Had to replace batteries constantly. By accident the base got wet and the dispenser did not work after even with the batteries replaced less than a year. I had to dispose of it. 	0
10108	Squeezable down to nothing. The pillows are soft but you could basically compress it down into a medium-sized purse. They present well but there's very little in them. I like soft pillows but I'd still like to lay on a pillow. They'll flatten out to feel like you're not laying on anything at all. If you need pillows just for show, these are great, but if you want to USE them, I suggest looking elsewhere. 	0
10109	Not very child proof.. It only took my 2 year old 3 days to figure out how to work this lock. I did a lot of research before buying this lock because I read it was really tough to figure out (from a toddler's perspective). Either she is too smart or the lock is not as child proof as it should be. 	0
10110	Two Stars. Too difficult to put together. 	0
10111	The Design Does Not Work - at least for me!. The sharp bend of the crevice tool did not allow the lint to flow from the dryer into the vacuum cleaner. After using it for just a few seconds I noticed that the lint was not been extracted ... looking closely into the tool I found lint stuck inside and noticed that the passage narrowed greatly, thereby not allowing the lint to flow through. Tried blowing the lint out; tried straightening the tool so the stuck lint would flow out -- no luck. 	0
10112	The curtain itself is good, but the holes are too small for shower .... The curtain itself is good, but the holes are too small for shower curtain rings I have. It comes with plastic rings, but they look really cheap and I prefer not to use them. 	0
10113	Not worth the money. I wish I would have known to pay attention to the "voltage" or some sort of suction rating. While I love the attachments it's barely more useful than a broom. I end up sweeping after it for all the pieces this misses. 	0
10114	Ok. The length was good. Quick delivery but the color looks more greenish then gray. I desperately need them so can't return. Will try to get another color. 	0
10115	Looks nice, but for how long?. The product looks nice and will do what it's intended for, but it arrived with scratches in the acrylic which make me question how long before it looks like trash. Shelf inserts were a nice touch though. 	0
10116	Not very soft. Still hurts my feet. 	0
10117	Doesn't Fit Shark Navigator!. The attachment cleaning tool doesn't fit on my Shark Navigator. The item seems to be made of sturdy plastic, but I'm unable to use it. This item needs more fittings to accommodate various vacuums. This isn't as "Universal" as we're led to believe. I'm disappointed. Returning for refund. 	0
10118	Doesn't hang beautifully ruffled and gathered like picture.. It just doesnt look like picture. The picture looks tightly gathered and beautifully ruffled. I've had it awhile now and I'm going to take it off bed and try to do some sewing to it and see if I can fix it. I probably should have returned it right away but it's too late now and I think with some adjustments I can make it work. 	0
10119	Doesn't actually do any air "cleaning". Bought this as a humidifier, the "air cleaning" part is actually false advertising; depending on how hard your water is, sediment does accumulate in the bottom, but none of that is any dust in your home unless you live in a coal mine or something. As a humidifier, I would rate it as slightly less effective than a wick type humidifier with the same fan size. The advantage is that it doesn't consume wicks. Given the additional cost of the unit, you probably have to run it for about 5 years to make the difference up. It does have a fairly large water capacity for its size, since the 'tank' is integral to the unit, and it's low power (although no better than a wick type). It is also fairly easy to clean, although the plastic disks can't really be serviced since the disk unit can't be disassembled. However, for German engineering, the build quality isn't great. I've had mine for a year now, which would be about six months of cold weather run time, and the unit has developed a very annoying rattling noise from the fan assembly. My guess would be the fan bearings, so I'm just waiting for complete failure to happen here. As noted by someone else, any repairs are almost equivalent to just buying a new wick humidifier. tl; dr - not worth the extra cost, you are better off with a wick humidifier. 	0
10120	Light turns on... This lamp looks and feels very cheap however for $10 it does the job. Item did not come with remote (box has picture of lamp with remote) and the motion sensor does not work. I chose this item because it said Amazons Choice, however it was not what I was expecting! 	0
10121	DIY wall. Completely thought this was a wall decal that‚Äôs sticks right away. You have to remove the butterflies from the card and still put the adhesive sticker on it. Some stickers are a bit big for the butterfly. It still looks nice, but requires a bit more effort than other wall decals 	0
10122	Very wrinkled.. Bought a few for craft show tables. I‚Äôve owned them for years & I just can‚Äôt get the wrinkles out. 	0
10123	Love the sponges! But service not so good.. I love these sponges for removing threads from project. But I ordered a 12- pack and first order only included one sponge. Second time, this was supposed to be corrected and only received one sponge in that order also. 	0
10124	Fits but won't stay in place.. Love the quilted material. The rod inserts are a good idea, the slipcover arms and rods pull out even with the slightest recline. The advertisement says " straps", but there is only one strap for the chair back in the package. Will fold the arms underneath the seat portion to try and get some use from the product. Very disappointed. 	0
10125	They are uncomfortable!. They are very uncomfortable. I can't sleep on them!! 	0
10126	Two Stars. The main LED light doesn't work. The two red lights do work. 	0
10127	Extra fragile. They were beautiful but way to fragile. One cracked while putting gumballs inside and the second while washing at the end of the party. I am left with only one. Very disappointed. 	0
10128	Basically ordering from Wish. Took forever to arrive. Once it did... was in packaging from the Wish app. And mangled at that. 	0
10129	Color is off from picture. Was way more orange looking then the pictures, it is a very bright light orange color. 	0
10130	Not very durable. On the second attempt to reuse the stencil before it pulled apart. Very disappointed Martha. Expected better quality from you. 	0
10131	Not what it looks like.... Looks too much like christmas lights 	0
10132	Item not as featured.. I cannot rate the efficiency of the unit because I've not been able to use - only directions enclosed are written in Chinese, not a language I am versed in. Additionally, received an entirely different brand of unit, similar in look but not what I actually ordered. Contacted vendor who had offered to send an instructional video (did not) and did not address the brand switch. Without further email exchange I was given a $10 credit toward the unit cost of ~$30 - appreciated but not what I asked for so now I've spent only $20 on an item that is going unused (until I can locate some online user instructions. Oh well... 	0
10133	Not as described. The vases I purchased were not what I expected. Quite a few were covered in wax, I recieved 16 not 18 and there was no cleaning cloth included. 	0
10134	Figured it would be like the sand type ones that flatten against the door. Way lighter than I thought. Figured it would be like the sand type ones that flatten against the door. Its just a stuffed pillow 	0
10135	Not Durable. These are soft and comfortable. However, one strap tore off in about a week. 	0
10136	Will not last.. Broke after a month. 	0
10137	Value pillowcases. These are just ok. Pretty thin, I think, and not very soft or silky. Not exactly what I was looking for but I don't want to bother returning them so I'll use them anyhow. 	0
10138	Not Durable. I had this cart for about three weeks and the handle broke, leaving me without a suitable cart for my supplies. 	0
10139	Junk. Ive just had the second one fail on me.....they last about 1-2 years then the LCD starts to fail. I was smart and purchase Asurion insurance with the second one......just filed a claim now - bext $4 ive purchased :) Almost feel bad making the claim as i knew probably was going to fail based on previous experience. This said....when its working the la Crosse unit is very functional and stylish.....this said they've now withdrawn it from their line....i assume because they kept failing/return rates. 	0
10140	Didn't receive the correct quantity!. Order said 50 boxes I only received 27 boxes! 	0
10141	Too soft. I did notice if you could order it in firm. I got a neck ache. 	0
10142	Poor quality, bottoms not strong enough to support weight.. This is not good quality, and will not hold much weight, card board bottoms bend. A little stronger built would improve this product. 	0
10143	Super cute, entirely unusable as oven mits. I really wanted to like these. So cute hanging on a hook on my fridge! Unfortunately that's all they are good for. There's no thumbs and they don't bend, so it's really impractical to pick anything up. 	0
10144	Hardware doesn't match. I love these shelves but I was pissed when I went to put them up. The metal washer covers don't fit over all the plastic washer. So, I was stuck leaving the ugly black plastic washers showing. Very upsetting. You can't tell this at first glance either unless you physically put the washers inside of a metal piece. 	0
10145	Not as advertised!. Each of these operates on 3 triple A batteries which they burn through rapidly. Plus, they are not nearly as bright as suggested. Find another source. I query the rave reviews. 	0
10146	4 mos life span ..... given as a gift... don't i feel silly.. Gave as Christmas gift, stopped working 3 mos. later. Very disappointed because it was a nice product and gave off a good amount of humidity to the air unlike some. I also thought it had a nice style. My return windo is closed unfortunately. 	0
10147	Not really a great quality product. Look else ware. Not really a great quality product. 	0
10148	Looks like circus tent material. Looks like circus tent material, but it fits well on the bed and looks a bit better than nothing if you want to hide stuff you keep under your bed. 	0
10149	Didn‚Äôt work for us. Applied these rubbed then as much as possible , daughter woke up and most were on the floor . The color is wasn‚Äôt quite Rose gold . Bummer what a waste and can‚Äôt return 	0
10150	Won't stick on the glass. Can see through them.. I tried and tried, but the top and bottom corners of these panels curled and fell out repeatedly. I washed the windows first. I cut and then let the panels warm up, I wetted with soapy water. I used a squeegee. I even tried to hold the tops in place with double sided tape, and the bottoms curled up too. I'm very disappointed and have to come up with another idea. And FYI, if you are close to the panels, you can see what's on the side. 	0
10151	Color off?. Is this really white air dry clay? Maybe it's going to dry white? Much darker color than expected. 	0
10152	I wanted to give these five stars but the dark .... I wanted to give these five stars but the dark green has already died after coloring one small area. The rest are going strong after much more coloring but I'm bummed not to have a full set right after the first use. 	0
10153	It only works on smooth surfaces not good. This may is no good to me because it won't work on tubes that have any type of texture on the tub. It would be nice if you have that in your description. The tub has to be totally smooth to use. 	0
10154	Cheaply made. Waste of money.. One wire broke after a few uses. Not recommended. 	0
10155	All sets do not flash. You need a red bulb in order for them to flash but only one of the 3 sets I bought has them. 	0
10156	Snag easily. These sheets are soft as silk but they snag badly!üòû 	0
10157	NOT COOLING!!!. They are soft sheets. I only bought them for the cooling feature. They do NOT cool at all!!!! Do not buy for this feature. 	0
10158	I LOVE THE SIZE BUT DOESNT PULL SMOKE & ODERS OUT. I LOVE THE SIZE BUT DOESNT PULL SMOKE & ODERS OUT. THE ODERS INSTEAD OF SUCKING IN, THEY SEEM TO BLOW OUT. 	0
10159	Its definitely cabinet lining!. I liked how thick the product was also very sticky but it was very difficult to install and had a lot of air bubbles underneath that I was unable to remove 	0
10160	Pillow covers only no pillows. The image portrayed in this advertisement but lead you to believe that you are ordering pillows order some pillow covers and looking for pillows and ran into this advertisement once I order they came they were the same as the order I had before just covers 	0
10161	Low quality material. The pillow is comfortable enough, but I‚Äôve only had it two months and a big hole has already ripped in the case. Good thing I only need it to last three more months. Hopefully the whole thing doesn‚Äôt disintegrate by then. 	0
10162	Handles broke after 4 months of use. I loved this organizer until one side of each of the two handles broke after only about 4 months of use. 	0
10163	Very nice, if it did it's job!. I wanted to like this; the material it was made out of was very soft and it was a nice size for what I needed. However, this support is too soft for its own good. What good is a back SUPPORT that just squishes as you lean into it? Unfortunately, this SUPPORT did nothing but squish for me, and I returned it. If you're truly looking for SUPPORT I'd look elsewhere. 	0
10164	This can't be used without a plastic liner. It states this curtain can be used as is for a shower however upon the first use it became quite saturated and this continued after my next few showers. I gave up and had to get a clear liner because I didn't want mold. 	0
10165	read the reviews.... they will give you clues!. ok, so I read the reviews before buying. I noticed there were a lot of people saying that it will come off on your clothes and what not. I have to fairly and honestly score it at 50% which I would think is an F.... but it is half of 100% so I gave it 3 stars. This stuff at first looked like it worked GREAT. I had restored the bad spots really well and I did it over several days adding on dye and letting dry in the hot garage. While i was moving it a little sweat fell on it from my face.... I went to wipe it off and with the sweat came due as well.... TALK ABOUT A BUMBER! So I took a wet cloth and wiped it... Just about all of it came off.... now after it was all off, the areas were a little darker than they were before... but clearly still not fixed. so I'm not sure if I need to get a darker color to just do a single coat or what? but I do know that I dont wosh to waste my money again. 	0
10166	Such a handy little vacuum! It's compact enough to .... Such a handy little vacuum! It's compact enough to fit under my side table to stay out of sight until it's time to vacuum. Keeps our floors clean and dust-free! ***UPDATE: After only a few days of working, the vacuum started switching directions for no reason and skipping areas of the floor and not cleaning consistently. Will be returning*** 	0
10167	Too hot. Base got way too hot. Worried about a fire hazard. My daughter really wanted a lava lamp but I didn‚Äôt think it was safe enough to have something that got so hot in her room. 	0
10168	Wouldn‚Äôt buy this picture. Picture doesn‚Äôt come out very clear. Everyone asks what it is a picture of. Very abstract 	0
10169	Not enough diamonds. Diamonds were insufficient to finish the painting., did not line up right and square diamonds were mixed in with the rounds. Very dissatisfied with this painting 	0
10170	Cheap quality. This brand cracks a lot. Not great quality but I‚Äôll let my kids paint with it and get some better stuff for myself. 	0
10171	Not the suction power I had hoped for. Threw mine away after using it twice. 	0
10172	Quality looked great - I wish they actually had a blue one. The comforter was very gray, not at all blue as depicted in the picture. I didn't even take it out of the bag because the color was so different from what I was expecting. Quality looked great - I wish they actually had a blue one! 	0
10173	They look great but they broke in several places just from picking .... I bought these boxes to move. They look great but they broke in several places just from picking them up -and the handles came off and they are hard to get back in place. I would not recommend for the price. 	0
10174	Made with felt not a soft fabric. Felt, need I say more? From the picture I thought I was buying a soft, silky flower. 	0
10175	Loud!. I bought this for my son‚Äôs new bed but am sending it back immediately! It‚Äôs very soft and a little plush but has plastic in it so it‚Äôs So noisy!! 	0
10176	These are freaking adorable! I hung pictures from them. These are freaking adorable! I hung pictures from them. I had these rated a 5 star when i first got them up until I‚Äôve had them for two days and the lights went out. Changed the batteries & still won‚Äôt work. All the clips worked fine & it was cute. But the whole point was to have a suttle light & they stopped working. Return started. 	0
10177	Chic and cute but no. This was the end result after not even 2 weeks. The idea and concept is cute but just didn‚Äôt work for me: maybe because the paint on my walls? I‚Äôm really not sure but these peeled right off the wall and took my paint with it. Btw it will not hold a swiffer mop 	0
10178	Two Stars. There is a recall on this unit due to fire hazard. How do I go about returning this? 	0
10179	Where is it made from. The price of the item was too much and the quality wasn‚Äôt worth it 	0
10180	I placed 2 suits in a garment bag and seam .... I placed 2 suits in a garment bag and seam on the side split open. Unfortunately it is now too late to send them back. 	0
10181	Not a bag for travel !. Not a travel bag. Very light material. Maybe inside a suit case but whats the sense in that. Returned it immediately. 	0
10182	Take too long for delivery.. Take too long for delivery. 	0
10183	Looks nice but poor quality. Easy to assemble a looks nice... but very poor quality. The rod disconnected from the base and fell over after only a few weeks of use. 	0
10184	Isn't Dyson supposed to be engineering marvels. Cheap garbage thin plastic. Tiny dust collection bin that contains a filter, makes sense BUT pet hair doesn't want to come out. Have to stick your fingers into the open collection bin to out it loose. That's messy and gross. Hose/wand removal from handle body is awkward and the cheap plastic construction makes you baby it. Hose suction is less than impressive anyway. The handle is difficult to lock into the upright storage position and regularly, when you think it is locked up, it isn't, and therefore falls hard to the floor. It steers like a dream! ....yeah that doesn't make up for its shortfalls. Not even close really. Returned this piece of junk and bought a Shark with a nice big dust collection bin/cylinder. 	0
10185	150% More Ink Only Because Pens Aren't Filled With Ink.. I just got these pens... literally out of the box and 3/4 of them aren't completely filled with ink. One of the blue ones (see photo) has so little ink that it looks completely empty. This was not a cheap set compared to others available, but the colors looked nice and I thought I'd give them a try. At almost $30, I should have just stuck to the cheaper sets. At least it wouldn't have cost me as much to replace them when they ran out of ink. 	0
10186	Not sure yet!!!. Comforter looks very thin. Does not look like a full even though it was advertised as one! It has not been washed or used yet since it is a gift. Hopefully the stitching & color hold up. I am worried about the quality of this product just from looking at it. I really hope it can handle being used on a child's bed, since that it what it was intended for.... frequent wear & tear and frequent washing.... we'll see..... The price was a little high for such a thin "comforter", claiming to be for a full size bed. This barely covers a full! 	0
10187	Way better mattress covers on the market then this one. How can this be bed bug proof If it doesn't completely close the mattress in. I was disappointed that the mattress cover didn't completely closed the mattress inside it just went on top that's no protection at all. 	0
10188	Two Stars. These shed too much. 	0
10189	Not as expected. Insert for between was hard to put in place. Once in, it was lumpy. May fall into place after use, but not as expected. 	0
10190	Very thin.. Ordered this for my son. We waited for 3weeks to arrive. The left side where the whole for the garter is torn so we had to tape it. The black paint was erased after a week. This mask is really thin. 	0
10191	Read the description carefully. Yes if you drill into the entire add they are the small size that they say they are. However I was only searching in standard size bed pillows which every ad before it and after it we're the same even though they were more money. This was totally not what I was looking for and it's also my fault for not double-checking. Now I have four really nice new standard size pillow cases and these little tiny pillows... 	0
10192	Not soft. Pros: Good size, almost covers the top of our queen mattress Cons: Not as soft as it looks. Very heavy, but not because the pile of the fur is so lush, but because it's 2 pieces of fabric sewn together, and the backing is heavy, like faux leather. The fur is short, and has a rubber feel to it. My 12 year old daughter said it made her skin feel itchy. 	0
10193	Nice, soft fabric. I like this fabric. It's very soft and comfortable. It came out of the bag with a strong musty smell. It was fine after washing. Love the throw pillows. Wish the shams were reversible like the rest of the set. They could have easily put the opening on the end so both designs could be used. All in all very happy with this as a warmer weather bedset. 	1
10194	Fits larger spaces..... I put this pair of flamingos on my shower doors. The legs are a little tricky, but you just need to slow down and take your time. I am very happy that this decal is repositionable. 	1
10195	Four Stars. The jasmine smells amazing. The Rose smells cheap. Overall decent quality 	1
10196	Needs a clamp!!. Exactly what I was looking for. Nice height adjustable easel. That said the directions were in Chinese, but I was able to follow the pictures. Please look at the picture I had to clamp the bottom tray just touching it will cause it to fold. The clamp solved the problem but any child using this can collapse it easily. 	1
10197	Looks Great. Ordered to use with western themed tree! Blends with the theme well. 	1
10198	Just what I needed.... I needed something to hold my large collection of fashion jewelry that wasn't too obvious but let me see everything I have. I also wanted a full length mirror...and I found this! It was affordable, fit my needs and looks great. I mounted it on the wall but used a sturdier bracket underneath that doesn't show like the dinky brackets included with the cabinet. The mirror is huge, unlike the other cabinets I looked at that had little 10" mirrors. The quality of mirror is good too, no distortion to speak of. Very happy with this purchase and highly recommend! 	1
10199	Four Stars. Good product and fast delivery too. 	1
10200	Nice looking but stiff. Great looking but the fabric is stiff and somewhat harsh feeling to lay on. 	1
10201	but love the different design. Have yet to decide where to put them, but love the different design. They came in the box with the five corner shelves. Now I have to decide which way up I want them. I like them very much 	1
10202	Great color. Great color of dark brown. It was just what I needed for my dark chocolate brown leather couch. 	1
10203	Four Stars. very light but it works! 	1
10204	It works as intended. The product was bigger then expected but it works as it should. I'm very happy with it 	1
10205	Four Stars. Works good in the car 	1
10206	Festive addition to the table. Bought this for the table for our Halloween party. Cute, pretty durable, and as pictured. 	1
10207	Fit great. Bad odor at first.. Fit great. Only had one pillow case. Expected two. Had a funny industrial order when out of the box but was fine after washed and dried. 	1
10208	Nice and heavy. This was a great replacement for the bottom of our couch, but it was slightly too small to cover the bottom, so we tried to use three pieces to cover the entire bottom of the couch (to cover the holes our cats made) they, of course, found the seams between the layers and tore it out again. Would recommend if bottom of couch/chair is small enough to cover with a single piece of fabric. Was really easy to unfold/install (we used a staple gun to attach). Would order again if a larger width is available. 	1
10209	Lightweight. Love the color, BUT.... Love the color-teal.. When you wash it has a TONS of lint. Once dried looks great. Love that it is 100% cotton. I'm hoping the next wash will not have alot of lint. 	1
10210	not worth what I paid. Seriously, go to walMart, and you will get a better deal. Not nearly as good as I had hoped but it's sturdy 	1
10211	pumps are a little weak, but works well if soap isn't too thick. I wanted a soap dispenser that didn't take up much room for our bathrooms. This works pretty well, although the pump is a little weak for gel soap. One pump didn't seem strong enough to work at all, but fortunately, there was an extra, and also it's a standard size, so I could use one from an old dispenser for one of them. In some ways, I like this better, as not too much comes out at a time, and so far, it's been reliable. 	1
10212	Just wish it had better staying tension because If you pull the drapes too .... Serves the purpose of what I needed this for. I just bought it to hold a set of drapes in a doorway. Just wish it had better staying tension because If you pull the drapes too hard you may pull the pole down too. 	1
10213	Decent quality, instructions are unclear. These are very reasonably priced, and while they aren't an especially convincing wood texture when you look at them up close, they do look a lot classier than basic white plastic blinds. I ordered one to see how it looked and now that know they're alright I'm ordering more for some of the other windows in my house. I did knock off a star because the instructions are really annoyingly unclear and while mine are stable and working fine I'm still not sure I installed them exactly as intended. If you've never put up blinds before I'd recommend finding a tutorial on youtube or something, that's what I resorted to after the first 20 minutes of scratching my head. 	1
10214	Good to fill the gap between door and ground or floor. You may need to cut it to the size you need but it's easy to do. 	1
10215	Great idea. Small is to large for twin XL 	1
10216	I love what this is. I love what this is, but... I placed the stand on a white dresser and it stained it. Then I tried to get it off and no luck. Great size though 	1
10217	Nice material. Feels like linen.. Haven‚Äôt actually used as saving for move n new house. Reason for not giving a 5. 	1
10218	Perfect for what I need. Very easy to install 	1
10219	Four Stars. Love it... exactly what is described.. If i had enough bathrooms i would have one in every color. 	1
10220	Four Stars. it works but it‚Äôs hard to pull the bags from the bottom, I just pull it from the top. 	1
10221	Looks great. Like the ease of clock to use with my project. Dislike I had to get special batteries /carbon bs alkaline. It wasn‚Äôt that easy to get hands put on, And metal bent easily. 	1
10222	Nice protector, but I question its longevity as it .... Nice protector, but I question its longevity as it got a small chip on the edge within a day of application. It isn‚Äôt totally clear, but is anti fingerprint. 	1
10223	It works. It's the size of a child's toy. Good to use for a light touch up before company. It takes a while to get the same spot clean. 	1
10224	Look nice on invitations. These looked great. They looked very nice on the wedding invitations we put them on. We only had one break and had a few loose stones. 	1
10225	Body Support. I purchased this body pillow hoping it would help me after surgery. Let me just say, it was/is exactly what I needed! I couldn‚Äôt have made a better decision. 	1
10226	Recommended for small spaces. I bought this item to store dirty clothes. It's good to take to the laundromat. Just don't put too much weight on it. I put a heavier load of dirty clothes, than usual, on it once and the handles ripped off. Luckily, it has two handles (shown in photo) so it's still usable. It CAN hold a lot of clothes because it is deep and the material stretches if you plan on not transporting it. However, if you plan to take the hamper laundromat don't overload it. Overall, I found this order very useful because it comes in a pack of two, so I can easily organize my whites and colors when doing laundry. When I only need to use one, I can easily fold the other and it does not take much space to store. I rent a small room, so I wanted something that wouldn't take as much space and is affordable. I'm happy with my purchase. 	1
10227	Four Stars. Looks great but pockets are smaller than I expected 	1
10228	Ready to go. The organizer comes ready to go just open box but in drawers and thats it no drilling. I also found that it has some weight and is not flimsy. I found that the stackable organizer worked better in my garage then the kitchen because of the smaller drawers, but in the work bench or on the counter there are multiple items that fit in smaller drawers. 	1
10229	Cute little lanterns.. Cute outdoor lanterns. I purchased two rubbed bronze ones. They have a black and gold color to them. They are not too bad for the price. I paired them with a real black, metal lantern and it‚Äôs hard to tell that they are plastic. The candles are bright. I like the timer function. I don‚Äôt have to turn them on/off every night and they come on/turn off at the same time. As you can tell, the candles look almost as good, if not as good, as the Luminara candle in my metal lantern. They were well packaged and arrived quickly. 	1
10230	Nothing.. Little bit other types noise 	1
10231	Does the trick. I bought them to hang hats from.. Works great for that purpose but they aren't really well made. Ok for the money 	1
10232	Great for a quick press on the go!. Great for a quick press! Love that it heats up fast! I totally recommend this! It works! 	1
10233	Wrong color. I received white rose lights instead of the pink ones I ordered. 	1
10234	Beautiful stone, loose setting. The stone is beautiful but the setting is loose, the stone already fell out. I‚Äôm glad I heard it fall. 	1
10235	worked like suppose to. Used on my ice maker, worked like suppose to. 	1
10236	Just what I expected!. Just what I expected. Took stain beautifully! Very happy with my project. Pretty heavy block of wood. 	1
10237	A satisfied customer. I was pleasantly surprised by the material used in making this curtain. It makes my bathroom look fantastic, fancier than what it is. The curtain darkens the room just like it states it would. A great purchase, I would recommend it to my friends and family. 	1
10238	Seems fine, just wish it cold be adjusted to a lower level. It definitely produces ozone. We have it in a bathroom where the cat box is, and that is the only reason we got it: to deal with those odors, which it does easily. It produces far more that needed for that job. Which would be OK, I figure the excess will get pulled out by the central vent system that is in a nearby hallway, and be spread through the rest of the house and possibly give some benefits. But sometimes when going in that room, the ozone smell is a bit excessive. But, it does produce ozone, just like it says. And it is adjustable, but I would prefer it could be turned down a bit more. 	1
10239	Good service & fast delivery when needed. Thank you again. I enjoyed using this product, very helpful limit more space for my use. Thank you 	1
10240	Looks very nice. Love the product overall, the only reason why I give it 4 stars is because of the way it‚Äôs packaged. It makes it difficult to unravel because you have to be careful not to have the ornaments fall off, and one did but its fine 	1
10241	Decent for the Price. This plant is pretty good for the price. Does appear slightly artificial up close but looks great from a distance. 	1
10242	Comfortable memory foam back support. The product came in time for the birthday party. He liked it and said it works great and gives him the back support that his office chair doesn't 	1
10243	We bought it during the fires in Northern California when we were having very bad air days. This has performed quite well. We bought it during the fires in Northern California when we were having very bad air days. What's amazed me is how much dust it picks up from the air itself. I vacuum the screens every week or so and they're quite full of dust. Which we're not breathing now, so that's good. 	1
10244	Durable and a good size. I had just gone through my last laundry hamper and was in desperate need for a replacement. This does the job, is durable and can fit a weeks load of dirty laundry. 	1
10245	Pleased with item.. Great product. Only complaint I have was in packaging some paints did leak. Otherwise excellent! 	1
10246	Really cute & Quick delivery. Order was correct and on time. They looked really cute when blown up. Only thing I would say is that the string provided wasn't long enough to fit all the letters on. I had to make shift a second string. 	1
10247	Four Stars. Purchased this for an elderly relative. Had to leave before I could find out if it worked out. 	1
10248	Meh..... A bit smaller than expected but not enough to deal with the hassle of returns..... 	1
10249	Nice replacement hose.. It works as well as the original, but it isn‚Äôt the same. The membrane vinyl over the wire seems thinner than the original. Also it stretches in a different way ‚Äî in stretches in segments rather than as a whole. Although the vinyl is thinner, hopefully it is more resistant to cracking like the original. 	1
10250	Four Stars. works really well on glass (without falling)... 	1
10251	So far so good! Though missing an item. seems sturdy enough though missing clips Update: Their customer service contacted me and kindly send a replacemt 	1
10252	Glue-free installation is easy. I like knowing it will not leave nasty glue all over my windows when I stop using the film when I finally get around to picking window treatments. I did have small air bubbles pop up around the edges when the temp went below freezing outside which is the reason for 4 stars instead of 5. Not very noticeable, worth it for the film being easier to install and remove than the type with glue! 	1
10253	Simple stylish and gets the job done. Price can't be beat!. Slightly lightweight but otherwise perfect item. I do wish it had a weighted base cell when you are pulling out toilet paper that stuck can won't wobble around. 	1
10254	About what was respected. They work but are thin. I wasn't surprised given the price. 	1
10255	Wrong Color. I like the product. It is what I expected. I ordered a black can. I got grey. 	1
10256	Great!. Great product, one of he flowers did fall off 	1
10257	I think it work good. I could tell the difference before and after .... I think it work good. I could tell the difference before and after application. 	1
10258	Very nice bottom sheet.. This sheet was just what I was looking for. I found the elastic unnecessary for my use and cut it off on one corner. Fits perfectly on my pillow top mattress. 	1
10259	Super soft... The cover and shams look as pictured. Very soft and comfortable. Its very delicate, I tore a hole by the zipper very easily. I did not return cover because it was super cheap. 	1
10260	Functional but plastic. These are great for blocking out light but they are plastic tracks and are not going to look like professional blind tracks. You get what you pay for. They were definitely easy to install and serve their purpose. 	1
10261	Slipcovers. Loved the product but it didn ‚Äòt fit the chair and it was returned for refund. 	1
10262	Sheets. These have been good sheets. Haven't seen any issues with them so far. 	1
10263	Strong but the nozzle tends to pop off. This is a great hose and it fits my needs perfectly. Unfortunately the nozzle will come off somewhat frequently, though it is easy to screw/pop back on. 	1
10264	Doesn‚Äôt Work!. I bought this a couple months ago to be prepared for the summer, and when I went to use it this week it doesn‚Äôt work! I have tried both batteries and neither seem to charge. It turned on one time for about 5 minutes and nothing since. What a disappointment! Do not buy, it‚Äôs a waste of money! Update: shortly after reading my review the company reached out to me and sent me TWO replacements that have been working great! I greatly appreciate them replacing it free of charge! 	1
10265	Multi size pom pom maker , Great Buy !. How to go over the directions a couple of times but once done , easy , Best to shake them off outside after cutting. ! They will shed. Multi 	1
10266	Nice, but short for larger hands.. I think these are about 1/2 inch too short to be very comfortable in my fairly large hands, but the surfaces are nice as are the fittings. 	1
10267	Works fine. The brush works fine for dishes, and for cleaning cast iron cookware. The bristles will take whatever form they were last dried in, so should be reformed after each use to avoid having the brush go flat. I have used other brushes which better retain their form. 	1
10268	Best LED Mirror Ever!!!. Best purchase I have ever made!!! This mirror is amazing! I highly recommend this product super sturdy, lighting is perfect, super cute and easy to use! I‚Äôm recommending this to all my co workers! I‚Äôm honestly thinking about buying a second one for myself and a couple for Christmas gifts (: 	1
10269	Great travel storage. It's study and lightweight. Perfect for taking my projects on vacation and keeping everything organized, which is why I bought it. The storage on top is a little awkward for my longer needles, with the diagonal zipper, but all in all I have no complaints. My project was small and I was able to fit more yarn in the back storage pocket for additional projects/needles. The carrying handle is thin, but sturdy and does the job. 	1
10270	So soft and durable. Everything I been looking for in a washcloth. Not to light perfect weight, the size is perfect and the durability is wonderful. They feel so soft after being washed the first time. Will definitely be buying again for sure. 	1
10271	... clean pair of sheets that where definitely cheap but good quality and i have found them they are the .... I bought these sheets because i was looking for a brand new clean pair of sheets that where definitely cheap but good quality and i have found them they are the best sheets white just always looks so clean and i could say i can impress females because they are so easy to wash and how i said soft. i have had my pair of sheets for a little over 3 months and no regrets i love the sheets they have been washed more then 10 times already and still like brand new as i wash them more and more the softer they get i recommend the sheets to everyone besides the price is unbeatable they are phenomenal. i am about to purchase about 3 more pair of sheets for the guest room and for my roommate 	1
10272	Five Stars. It was so beautiful. 	1
10273	Better than Yeti, cool colors!. First off, it's in my favorite color! They have a great choice of colors, and orange is mine. It arrived in great shape and is a thing of beauty. I got tired of my ex wife waxing lyrical about her stupid Yeti (in blah stainless steel), so I did the ice test: eight ice cubes in each tumbler, same temperature, side by side. The swig actually had slightly less melted ice than her Yeti, so that's a victory for team Swig! I also bought the can cooler, and as I go along, will purchase all of the Swig products in orange. You absolutely cannot go wrong with this product! 	1
10274	Five Stars. Easy to peel and stick. They don't fall off. 	1
10275	Five Stars. Great service and quality 	1
10276	This is great. My favorite part is that you can choose .... Ordered this to put in my sons room. The heat gets trapped in the corner where his bed is and I wanted just a small fan to help circulate the air. This is great. My favorite part is that you can choose the angle. Shared some pictures to show you. Enjoy yours! 	1
10277	Better than an electric blanket.. Puts out heat fast, even on low. 	1
10278	Great. Soft and protect my pillows and my sons allergies. 	1
10279	Great value. I always meal prep so I got these for my lunchbox to take to work. Awesome value for the price and love that it comes with a carrier. 	1
10280	Great. Just what I expected! Very nice! 	1
10281	Love. OMG. there are not enough stars to hit on this product!!!! Love love love 	1
10282	Race car. Works really good and goes super fast. 	1
10283	Compact. Awesome little pillow! Made it easy to transport on my motorcycle. 	1
10284	great item, works well & no leaking. This is a great item! I have it in my living room & it helps a lot! Not to small & not to big! works well no leaks! I've had problems in the past with leaks. Not this one! 	1
10285	he loved it.. This was a gift for my grandson....he loved it. 	1
10286	Great value. I am an artist and was asked to present a ‚Äúhow to‚Äù to a Girl Scout troop. It‚Äôs so reasonably priced I could afford to give one to each of the girls. I really appreciated having the opportunity to introduce art to those young people, and they LOVED walking away with this gift. 	1
10287	Very nice!. These I love. For sure will buy again. 	1
10288	Awesome resin!. At first I didn't care too much for this resin. But then I bought a better lamp and it works amazing! I noticed though if you leave it in for too long it does yellow a bit. But aside from that it's great! 	1
10289	Value. Tortoises seem to love it... haven‚Äôt tried it myself üòâ 	1
10290	Used for wedding. Worked perfect for my wedding tables 	1
10291	Great bang for your buck!. Ok so I have a lot of furniture in a small space and this little guy does an amazing job! We have 4 cats and it has no problem cleaning up all the cat hair. It gets under the couch and coffee table with ease. It's very easy to empty and clean , and since it doesn't require bags it's already saving me money. Might buy one for upstairs as well üíú 	1
10292	Good value. Haven‚Äôt used it but everything seems great 	1
10293	Very nice!. Cool for diy art & craft paper. 	1
10294	feels great and very light weight. great throw for high end sofa, and works with any style even contemporary sleek sectionals 	1
10295	BUY THEM. These smell fantastic and burn an extremely long time (some over an hour!) The scents are strong and linger many hours! Extremely happy with these! 	1
10296	Good value. Great variety. Thank you. 	1
10297	Just right. Easy to install, fits perfectly, and does a good job. 	1
10298	Five Stars. going to order more soon 	1
10299	... with prime and the sheets fits my thick mattress perfect. Will buy. Got order in 2 days with prime and the sheets fits my thick mattress perfect. Will buy again 	1
10300	Quiet and effective. Provides good amount of steam. Super quiet. 	1
10301	Attractive Japanese Kanji Clock. I love this clock! This is my third clock from this company. Two have been this same clock. One was a more ornate model, which I ended up not liking. The quality is good. This is a good vendor to deal with. Definitely recommend the clock and the vendor. 	1
10302	Great product. I have been using this is in my room with peppermint oil to keep bugs away and it seems to be helping. I had no problem figuring out how to use it. I like how it has different timers and auto shut off. My only concern is the oil seems to go faster than the water and I go through a bunch of oil. 	1
10303	Great value for the price.. They‚Äôre cute and work well for my kids. Price is definitely great for kids sheets. 	1
10304	Filters work as intended.. The filters arrived on time. The quality is as expected. 	1
10305	They‚Äôll never know the difference.... This fit the vaccum perfectly!!! My parents will never know I lost the original cap. Lol fast shipping too. It arrived in 2 days with standard shipping. 	1
10306	It is a great product. It looks awesome with the cigars in .... It is a great product. It looks awesome with the cigars in it and more importantly it keeps humility great. 	1
10307	very great. I like this concept, I think you have done an acceptable job, created a device that successfully burned down the letters of wood and other things, but I hope this letter is more straight, not a rounding end. This requires a slight rolling of the letter to make it even. I also hope that these letters will be further highlighted, because if you press too hard, it will also burn unnecessary background. 	1
10308	Words that can be used for anything.. I like the idea that there are words that an be used for many things. They cut clean with no problems. 	1
10309	Great product. These patches are easy to apply and stay on. I use them for my freestyle sensor. 	1
10310	soft and very comfortable.. Vibrant color, soft and very comfortable. 	1
10311	Bolster. Works great , use it quite often 	1
10312	I like it. Just like sucking large particles, I don't seem to see signs of blockage. This is the premise that I like it. 	1
10313	Exceeded my expectations. Absolutely love the set! My 2.5 yr old daughter is very happy with her bedding and describes the owl to us. 	1
10314	Great price and item!. Exactly as described. Beautiful rose gold color 	1
10315	Good French press. I love this product it‚Äôs worked great from the get go, I loved it so much and so did my boyfriend I bought him one too. My gray paint is coming off the bottom but apart from that everything seems to be working just fine. 	1
10316	Felting done faster with this sturdy needle.. Durable and super easy to use. Makes felting a hit faster. It comes in a Beautiful box to store it. Recommend. 	1
10317	Five Stars. Super nice box!!! Got it next day!! Made really well .. I'm happy with it 	1
10318	awsome. well built for the price 	1
10319	Super cute!. Super cute matching aprons! The color and design make it great for both mommy and daughter or mommy and son. I got them for my daughter in law and grandson to wear while baking together. He is only 1 year old but loves to hang out in the kitchen and play with the whisks and bowls. The apron will be big on him now though he is tall for his age. It appears to be the right size for a 2-3 year old. 	1
10320	Five Stars. I used for a party and was great ! 	1
10321	Great value. It's a perfect product, I use it for study and relaxation. Easy to assemble and lights are adjustable (can be turned off). It's also really quiet, barely any sound. If you need a diffuser that is for meditation, studying or relaxation, definitely pick this one!! Also, a great value for a 2 pack. 	1
10322	Cool Wood Clock. Really cool, small and LOUD alarm. Humidity function works well. REALLY BRIGHT - only downfall if there is one is no F only C on the temp (thankfully I know both) 	1
10323	Great template!. Love, love, love this! Made cutting my diamonds and triangles a breeze and corners were sharp and precise! 	1
10324	A fragrance for every mood!. I enjoy all the fragrances and the assortment is great. The only thing I don‚Äôt like is that nowhere does it tell me if they are natural or synthetic. 	1
10325	Great material and fit. I totally love this cover! It completely changed the look of my rustic cabin-looking futon. The futon itself is very well made and solid wood but the cover was old and ugly. This cover fit perfectly and it's super easy to put on. I did have my husband help on the side because the mattress was heavy, but otherwise the cover zips really fast. High quality zipper. The material is linen so perfect for kids and houses with pets. Not super soft but when people stay over I put sheets over it anyways so it's not a big deal. 	1
10326	Need to stay on bed. They are ok except. The fitted pops off. 	1
10327	Great water bottle. Great water bottle, wish it was slightly larger just so I didn't have to refill as frequently. Works like a charm, you set up the alarms so it notifies you to drink. Once it goes off, you can simply open the lid and drink and the alarm will cease. Well made product, good quality and bpa free. 	1
10328	Very Convenient. Easy to install. Looks good. Works well. 	1
10329	Great fit and feel.. You can feel the quality! Could not believe how nice these were compared to the ones I got for twice the price last time! I will buy again for sure. 	1
10330	Strong magnet. Great hold and strength on the magnet. Can be easily maneuvered to fit your needs for holding curtains back. 	1
10331	Only criticism might be that the OD doesn‚Äôt match so it‚Äôs very apparent that an adapter is being used but glad to be able to. Works perfectly. Only criticism might be that the OD doesn‚Äôt match so it‚Äôs very apparent that an adapter is being used but glad to be able to use old attachments! 	1
10332	Five Stars. Came as expected and upgraded hangers from smaller ones- Would definitely order again. 	1
10333	comfort. I am not sleep on the surface, but it still very comfortable. 	1
10334	Exactly what I was looking for!. Storage of boots in my coat closet was a mess! This fit the bill! The 2 tiered rack has enough room for snow boots to fit on either tier, it's made of a heavy duty plastic & was a snap to assemble. Now boots are not all over the bottom of my closet & I have enough room for my 2 vacuums with room to spare. 	1
10335	Five Stars. works great, wanted the specialty blades. 	1
10336	Very nice product.. Excellent quality for a reasonable price. 	1
10337	stronger than I expected. Great value. I thought 3mil would be flimsy but it is not. Good for storing things. 	1
10338	Pleasing buy. Very handy for when the common cold has gotten the worst of you. Bought this for my wife and she loves it. Sometimes she puts essential oils in the water which adds to a pleasant scent. 	1
10339	Good quality. This fit with just a little modification. Made my clock new again. So glad I bought this and rejuvenated my old clock which I like very much. 	1
10340	It's so fluffy I'm gonna die!. Seriously the fluffiest towels! The color is beautiful, exactly as pictured, and they are bigger than I expected. Plus, I spent the same amount of money for these that I would have on the "premium" (non-organic) towels from Wal-Mart. You can't go wrong. 	1
10341	Can use on many surfaces!. What a really great set of acrylics. My daughter has been painting with them since they came in. The colors come in a wide range of vibrant colors that have a smooth consistency. These paints are packed in aluminum tubes which allows the paint to not dry or crack over time. 	1
10342	Glad I purchased this. I found this stable and very helpful to get things off the floor, as well as to be able to store below and on top of. Nice that it's adjustable. 	1
10343	Fun for kids and adults. Great on carpet. Just okay on hard floors. Bad at little bits of paper. I love it for my girls to vacuum the carpet. The handle height is adjustable for them to use and they find it so fun. Praise God! 	1
10344	NO PUFFING UP OR LOOSE SNAGS OF FABRIC AFTER WASH!!!. I bought two sets. In White. One came with a couple light brown stains. Maybe dirt. Who knows. The lining plastic package was torn. Washed them immediately after arrival with TIDE & dirt removed! So I didn‚Äôt have to return it! The fabric does NOT puff up. Looks brand new even after wash! VERY SOFT! Wrinkle free as noted!!! Very white after washing with plain blue Tide detergent. Will buy again!!! AND AGAIN!! THANK YOU!!! 	1
10345	Five Stars. Makes life so much easier having a garbage right at your fingertips while you're cooking by the sink 	1
10346	Very pleased!. I finally had time to sit down and read the instructions. It was very simple. I set it up last night. Worked great. I'm going to get another one to set up in the front room. 	1
10347	Perfect fit High Quality. Quick shipping, Quality product, Perfect fit 	1
10348	Beautiful!. Love the look of these! They look like real tiles! They really aren't too bad to install. Hardest part was peeling the backing off, but found it worked better to peel the tile off of the backing... if that makes sense! 	1
10349	Would buy again.. Works very well. Easy to set alarms, and time. The snooze/backlight function is pretty neat too. The dim back light is also nice so that you can actually read the time in the dark. 	1
10350	Five Stars. Great price. Good quality. 	1
