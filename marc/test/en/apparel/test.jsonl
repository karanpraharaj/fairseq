Seriously, for the size they made the shorts underneath, which fit perfect on a 5’8’’ size 18, the skirt is like a super tight pencil skirt, the skirt is more a size 14-16. It might work better if I lose another 10 lbs, but then the shorts might be too baggy. And the inside front has this white secondary panel. I guess it’s for not showing anything on the front? But it’s stupid and super itchy and makes the suit fit all thick and bunchy on the front, and it’s waist band to knees, left outer seam to right outer seam. The back is smooth and silky and comfortable. Not gusseted, so it could crawl up if you get it fit too tight. I’m cutting out the weird white liner to see if that helps anything, and maybe the skirt wont slide up when it’s wet, or I may tack it to the side seam on the shirts. And no drawstring at the waist, which fits well on a small waist/ big booty combo, but might get heavy and pull down in water. Other than that, it’s a good length, hits the top of my kneecap/crease at the back of my knee. "}
