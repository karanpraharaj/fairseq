10000	Dulled beyond usability after one use. Dulled severely after a single use, caused the drill to buck and nearly took my father’s finger off. Tried it again several more times, and it caught and kicked every time. You get what you pay for. 	0
10001	Horrible low quality and very inaccurate DO NOT BUY. I bought this product and thought it was awesome in the box but when I shot it I discovered it jammed frequently and pinches you at the top unless your very careful and after about 10 ft the pellet curves upward severely. After it fell from a barely 2 ft tall coffee table it broke and would not cock Iv also noticed after reading a lot of reviews that this is frequent 	0
10002	Not worth the money.. This product seems worthless for me. I don’t think they work for anything. I am sorry I bought them. 	0
10003	One Star. Too stiff, barely zips, and is very bulky 	0
10004	Wrong!!. Received this today and it doesn’t fit my .40 clip very disappointing!! 	0
10005	don't bother. my expectations were low for a cheap scale. they were not met, scale doesnt work. popped the cover off the back to put a battery in and the wires were cut and damaged. wouldn't even turn on. sending it back. product is flimsy and cheap, spend 20 extra bucks on a better brand or scale. 	0
10006	It NEVER Worked!. When I received this product, I took the tracker out of the package and plugged it in in order to charge it-it never turned on! I did that was suggested, but to no avail! 	0
10007	Difficult to understand how to use.. Trying to figure out how to use it from terrible instructions in broken English. I understand the concepts but have not seen the results. 	0
10008	It’s just slides on your wrist. Wasn’t comfortable. Never wore it because it didn’t really stay on my wrist.. I have returned it. Did not like it. 	0
10009	They are not cut resistant.. I have a pair of these gloves from over 10 years ago. That pair is great, you can take a razor sharp knife and run in along the palm and nothing, no cuts, to tears.. Nothing. The new ones are garbage. I took the same knife and lightly ran it across the palm and it cut all the way through the glove. You can tell they are no longer made the same. Save your money and if you bought these DO NOT TRUST them. they offer NO cut resistance at all. 	0
10010	Be careful. I got this backpack Monday night and I was excited about it because I had seen many great reviews for it. I used it for the first time the next day to hold a fair amount of things, and while I was out I noticed this huge rip right down the middle that wasn't there before. I would have been more understanding if I had it for a few months but this was the first time I had put anything into it. I've never been more disappointed in a product before as I have with this backpack. Be very careful when considering purchasing this product. 	0
10011	Terrible service. When we received the scoreboard it was broken. We called for support and left our number for a call back. 3 days later no call. Terrible service! 	0
10012	You get what you pay for. Horrible product, misrepresented. I bought this as a tracker to use while I swim, and I didn't even get a proper chance to try it. First off, it's not water resistant and it is not recommended to use while swimming per the instruction manual. Second, it doesn't come with a charger. Instead, it suggests to use a USB plug or computer. Fine, we have lots of those around. When I try to get it into the port to charge it, however, it launches right back out. I'm not sure if there's something not compatible or if this is just poorly made, but I'm not going to sit and hold my device in while it charges. Lastly, the app keeps popping up ads, even when it's closed. Ads popped up while I was sending a text, which is very concerning. I then closed down all active apps on my phone, and saw yet another ad when I went to check the time 20 minutes later. Horrible product, I guess I get what I paid for... 	0
10013	Not a happy customer. I returned the product to the Vendor in December and have not received my refund yet. I found the product to be difficult to use. 	0
10014	DO NOT BUY! DEFECTIVE UNITS!. DO NOT BUY! Device did not work after the first use and the company is ignoring my return request. You want the device to be reliable when you need it. I no longer trust this brand. 	0
10015	Don’t buy. Had three weeks and corner grommet ripped out 	0
10016	Standard Picatinny accessories do not fit!. The rails fit my handguard just fine. Screws are long enough, inserts are the right size, and the rails have the little circular feature to prevent them from moving around. The problem is that none of my accessories fit the rails. It's like they're too narrow. I tried an Atlas bipod with the quick release and it doesn't tighten up. Neither do my Magpul forward grips. Spend a little extra and get quality rails. 	0
10017	They sent me the watch with a dead battery then .... They sent me the watch with a dead battery then wanted me to drive it down to ups for a return! 	0
10018	Not a good product, not worth money. I waited a long time to open this light because there was construction going on at my dock. I stored it in my bedroom away from the elements. I finally tried it out last week, the light worked the first night. Then each use since then it has become less and less bright and less LED cells are lighting up with each power up. I can’t find any info on the company to contact them and get customer service. I am very upset because I was very excited to finally use my light. :( 	0
10019	One Star. It was great until it ripped after 3 uses. 	0
10020	Waste of time and money. I tried these with 2 two different pens. The ink does not flow and the cartridge dries out after a few days. 	0
10021	Avoid. This is crap. Very thin. Lasted one day 	0
10022	looked like they were reselling a returned product. Arrived busted in 2 corners and the box was ripped, looked like they were reselling a returned product. 	0
10023	Came broken!. Ordered this for a Santa present and Christmas Eve noticed it came broken! 	0
10024	Not durable. Broke, started to tear immediately when pulling weight 	0
10025	One Star. i never received my package but it shows it was delivered. 	0
10026	A nice bag but now useless. Zipper broke right after return period expired. A nice bag but now useless. 	0
10027	Por performance.. It doesn't tract the steps accurately, I did several tests and it failed in most of them, besides, I need to take it out when taking a shower because isn't wanted proof. 	0
10028	This product is NOT PRIME. The product has a Prime badge but after 4 days Amazon said it is running late and I am eligible for a refund. The product did not show up in 5 days and I requested refund. I emailed the seller and he never responded. 	0
10029	Broke before I could even use it once. The first one I purchased broke after about a year so I went and order another one. The new one snapped in half while attached it to the hose. I barely tightened the thing at all and I'm not an olympic body builder or something. Very low quality. 	0
10030	At first I loved it because it looked good and was light weight. At first I loved it because it looked good and was light weight. However, the magnet stuck to everything that my arm came in contact with and pulled my fit bit off, such as the refrigerator door, my office building door, the car door, etc. I have had my fitbit for over 3 years with the original band but after having the new bracelet a month, I lost it last week when it fell off somewhere between my office and th e restaurant I walked to for lunch. Very very disappointed! Now I am, out the money for the bracelet and I have to buy another fitbit. 	0
10031	ordered January 24th, officially opened the box last week .... ordered January 24th, officially opened the box last week (end of March) and it stopped working after second use. Apparently no returns after 30 days. Screwed consumer 	0
10032	Hangs too low. Poor quality.. There is no adjustment on the belt loop connection and it hangs way too low on the thigh. When you've used others that are comfortable to run around with, this just feels cheap and poorly made. The plastic will probably not last with much use either. The material and velcro were robust, but the quick release velcro was not intuitive to setup. I returned this. 	0
10033	Should have known. Product description is for Men / Women / Youth - Size is a bit small. I have a big head. I admit it. I generally look for larger products for my noggin. I have a previous purchase of Gonex OTG goggles and wanted to "shop" and compare. The Gonex came with a great case, velvety bag, wipe cloths and were of a general higher build quality. I'm not returning the set, as my 6 year old and wife want to use them for snow this winter. Unfortunately, that wasn't the intent with the product. BE CAUTIOUS if you got a big melon! 	0
10034	Balls did not last. We bought all these balls to practice and at least 5 of them developed a "dead spot" within a few uses to the point where you could not use them anymore. I had bought these because I thought they would last for at least a season. Not what i expected. 	0
10035	Broke after two months. Broke in less than 2 months, and I’m only 110 lbs. Great product in the beginning, but the plastic is cheap and cracks if you put too much weight on it. It’s relatively easy to use compared to other boards. Stable center, low height, less wobbly in nature. I love the idea of it though. So much better than sitting all day and easier on the feet and back than just standing. Works your balance. 	0
10036	Snapped. Purchased June 2018 and snapped while I was using it 15 months later. This is not something I use extremely frequently, so the cause was not overuse. I guess I got me $7 worth, but it’s not very fun having a resistance band snap when you’re using it... 	0
10037	Two Stars. I assumed there would be two for this price! 	0
10038	Packaging horrible, hope the product is better.. Just received but haven’t opened it yet, however very disappointed in the appearance of the package. It’s crumbled, looks beats up, opened and parts looked to have been moved around. Quite disappointed for this being ordered through amazon. Hopefully product is not damaged. 	0
10039	Disappointed.. Bought it for its features. While it worked, it was fine. Problems: was too inconsistent in detecting shots and tee boxes. So requires intervention almost every hole to ensure accuracy. Impossible to play well if one was to focus on the app. And after 11 months, almost 60% of the sensors are no longer working. Save your money and hassle. 	0
10040	Two Stars. Balls were smaller than I thought they were going to be. 	0
10041	The product did not have the look and color as per description.. I returned this bottle unused. Didn't like the baby pink color and the pink and blue print of the insulation sleeve. The description said rose quartz, but it is just baby pink. The product looked like cheap plastic and did not appeal to me visually. 	0
10042	The size was to be most important. I’m very disappointed.. I like the quality but extremely too small. Looks like a 2x. 	0
10043	THis is not the same basketball you buy in store. I tried for a month to break this in... but it just isn't the same ball as the ones that others bring to your gym. It doesn't have the same grip or general feel, and looses air very quickly. Better than your average ball still, but not what I paid for and not worth $50+ 	0
10044	not as said. you cant see your shot very good at all!! 	0
10045	Two Stars. Well made, but needs to have a larger handle to hold really small. 	0
10046	Too transparent for my liking.. Though these technically serve their purpose, and are easy enough to handle, I personally wish these were not as transparent. Because they are so transparent, they actually are much lighter {individually} than the picture. You can see the covered Bingo card numbers right through these chips. I will look for some opaque (not transparent) colored chips. 	0
10047	Does not fit. Does not fit my 2002 Seadoo GTX DI, it is about 6 inches too short to cover the length of the ski. It is good quality so I’m very disapointed it does not fit like it says it should. 	0
10048	Fatal flaws. This is a handsome looking knife, but it has some fatal flaws. The locking feature broke within a few days of receiving it. This is too small a knife and too sharp an edge to have the blade swinging freely without the ability to lock it open. Also, this is a really heaving object for it's small size, making it pretty much useless as a knife you would carry around, which is kind of the purpose of a small knife like this. I had to send it back for a refund. 	0
10049	Replacement charger. I bought my fitness tracker and lost my charger and cannot find a replacement charger , I have ordered several chargers and can’t seem to find the right one! I also got my warranty emailed to me by amazon n the print is so small I can’t even see the link to click on. It will not reroute me to warranty and I can’t even find a phone number!!! 	0
10050	Hard to read in day light and not comfortable.. Hard to view in daylight. Would not recommend. 	0
10051	wheels don't roll. this skate board would be ok if the wheels moved normally. The bearing is so tight the wheels barley roll. I'm sending back and buying another brand. 	0
10052	First time use it bent.. Used as described, first time use, it hold but when finish out day found it bent. I was not expecting something like this for the price, the item and finishing looks well made but it seems material is too weak. Very disappointed 	0
10053	clasp very hard to open and close. I like the look of this band, really dresses up my fitbit. the clasp, however, is ridiculously hard to open and close. I was able to remove a link with the tool provided but there are no instructions provided at all. Would not buy again. 	0
10054	CHEAP. Not going to last long, used it one day and corners are already chipping 	0
10055	tight fit. Very tight fit in the fingers. Hand fit is good. Never have had to wear a workout glove larger than a large. 	0
10056	Two Stars. Does the job but not stylish 	0
10057	Good concept. Good concept as personally I need one lease Forbes bicycling one for driving one for other. Problem 1/3 lens doesn’t work it won’t snap in. Going to keep it, but this is a vendor quality control issue they need to address. In my case black lense is cut to short, so won’t snap in. The frame fit on my head is very comfortable so is the nose piece. 	0
10058	Stays put with velcro. Gets caught in loops where velcro meets 	0
10059	Strap loosens very often. Bought 42mm for my series 3 .It looks good and exactly in the given picture however the strap loosens up very often .Not comfortable after you wear it for more than 15 minutes.The only good thing is that it comes from the protector which is quite useful to avoid any scratches .Overall disappointed with this strap.Have taken it off and gone back to the original sports strap from Apple. 	0
10060	Not the game...read carefully. Read closely....it's an expansion set...not the game 	0
10061	Two Stars. Comfortable, but NOT worth the $! 	0
10062	Two Stars. did not fit standard bar size. they resent free and still did not fit. 	0
10063	Not as Durable as would like.. Used the X-Heavy about once or twice a week for a month or so. Would put it around ankles and walk with it up and down room 4 times. It snapped the other day. They were ok, wish they were more durable and stronger, felt as though the X-Heavy wasn't as heavy as should have been. The other bands are way too light. 	0
10064	Not good. No weight baring at all!! 	0
10065	Find a better quality product. After 5 or 6 washings, these socks lost their elasticity at the top, causing the sock to fall inside my shoes beneath my heel. Find a better quality product. 	0
10066	The fist few weeks the items was great then the watch started to freeze. I purchased the item about 2 months ago. The fist few weeks the items was great then the watch started to freeze. I would have a blank screen at times the watch does the basic. There are some glitches 	0
10067	Two Stars. It lasted a month and it started to tear on the side and then tore up. 	0
10068	Keep lint roller close. Gets linty quick it's more of q cotton martial 	0
10069	Very poor packaging from seller. Rod came in a large box with ZERO packing material. Just a rod in a box, that was way too big. Lots of room to shift around. Rod tip guide was destroyed, I had to replace. Poor effort on the seller for sure. 	0
10070	Great material - awful quality. It's a huge disappointment. The fabric is perfect for my needs but the quality of the threads is just terrible. I've been wearing for 6 months for regular weightlifting and it's already worn. There threads are now lose and compression is lost, even though I ordered a size larger specifically to avoid putting too much pressure on the material, since it was already pointed out in other reviews that there is an issue with durability. In comparison, my under armour compression shorts have lasted for 5 years under the same type of training. I am ordering from Canada so it doesn't make any sense to be buying these considering the extra cost of importing. 	0
10071	Two Stars. The zipper pouch in the front has a cheap zipper and mine broke off rather quickly. 	0
10072	Wouldn’t buy again. Not all that great, hard to adjust, field of view isn’t wonderful 	0
10073	Bad carry case. Well I haven't stunned anyone...yet. So I can only rate what I know. I bought this because it was small and I could attach it to my belt. The belt loop strap on the case broke in the first 4 hours I had it. So now the convienence of being able to carry it on my side is lost. Now I'm going to have to invest in a case to carry it in. 	0
10074	Like wearing a diaper. Unless you're looking for a diaper fit I'd pass on these. Very thick material, not streamlined and just feels bulky. 	0
10075	Good material, but so small in shape. Should have listened to the reviews. The bill is half the size in length of a regular baseball cap. 	0
10076	Only received 7 bands. Did not receive a black band. Reached out to their customer support, have not heard back. 	0
10077	Looses Air. I've had the chair for two days and love it but unfortunately I've had to add air to the ball at the end of each day. I'm only 120 pounds and I don't believe I should have to add air that frequently 	0
10078	It gets 2 stars because the watch part works. This should not be sold as a fitness tracker. I have had it on 36 hrs now and it says I haven't slept at all, the steps are very in accurate and the camera button does not work. The reason I gave it 2 stars is because so far the time has stayed correct and if I have bluetooth on it lets me know calls and texts but dont try to read texts because they only fash across the screen once and there is not a way to look at them again. Since I paid $20 for it, I do not find it reasonable to pay shipping to return it. I will just use it as a watch until it dies. Nice job on making a slim design watch that actually fits my small wrists. 	0
10079	Not for use with essential oils!!. I got this bottle for drinking my essential oils. Must use a glass or stainless steel container. There is a small plastic ring in the lid that can not withstand the oils. So now that ring is gone and the lid won’t seal. 	0
10080	Not working. They seem to feel okay, well constructed. After wearing for a few hours they slip down my feet and don't do anything for the arch support. I would not recommend these if you have small feet like mine. I wear a size 6. 	0
10081	Great material and condition but the medical tag part keeps .... Great material and condition but the medical tag part keeps opening and I lost all my contact information that was in there the very first day. The clip alone is not very strong. 	0
10082	Meh. Not impressed... pain in ass putting cuffs back in. 	0
10083	Already put together.. Chair came fast. Already put together and ready to go. Instructions are old for xbox 360, Wii and PS3. So those need an update. You're going to be sitting straight up in this chair. No reclining back. Could use more padding on the seat. 	1
10084	Great set for the family. Great set for the family 	1
10085	Favorite knee straps. Great straps for short sets. They do slip but if you like to space out your sets then you have plenty of time to adjust them 	1
10086	When you run out of power.. when you run out of power, you need to re-adjust the time. 	1
10087	It’s ok.... So after playing with this watch all day I have to say not bad. Not great but not bad. I don’t like the fact that you have to remove the wrist band to charge the watch. Also that when lift to see the time doesn’t always work. When you use the watch to take a picture with your phone it doesn’t show you what the camera sees. It locates your phone with sound but if you use your phone to find your watch the watch vibrates which is useless. The other functions are ok but are a little glitchy. In the end It’s a nice cheap alternative for a child who wants smart watch. 	1
10088	Works great but door could be designed a little better. Works great but door could be designed a little better. Really, would it cost that much more to put hinges on it? 	1
10089	Lightweight and cheap (in a good way). This band is nice and soft. It is much lighter than the original rubber band that came with my apple watch. It compares to the genuine apple nylon sport band, but is made cheaper. For the price, I really can't complain. However, one thing to mention is the threading isn't perfectly consistent and some threads may come loose if you aren't gentle with it. 	1
10090	Amazing product. Highly recommend , I can use the cord or go wireless . 	1
10091	Love the clock!. I purchased this clock for my sewing room. It looks great! I think the price point is high for the size of clock. 	1
10092	Nice Looks, Good Value. I'm a novice and bought this as my 2nd paddle; seeing it as an upgrade from my first one. This Titan paddle feels a little heavier than my Ping Pong brand paddle and it looks better. The handle is nicely finished compared to my first paddle that had some rough spots I had to sand down. The rubber on the Titan is sticky and very grippy BUT my starter paddle seems pretty sticky too. In all, the paddle seems to be a good value. Time will tell. Before I move up to a paddle in the $50 - $100 range I will try one out to see if it makes that much difference in my game compared to how I play with the Titan. 	1
10093	Good deal. Better quality than I actually expected. Good amount of compression. I'm a nurse working 12 hour shifts, they have been nice to have. I only marked them down because the threads from the all over patterns leave marks on my legs. 	1
10094	Great price!. Great price for this type of watch band. Fairly thin, but works as expected with a good magnetic closure. 	1
10095	Four Stars. They run small. Order a size up. I'm a small and I should've gotten a medium. 	1
10096	Rep your team anywhere your from.. It looks great. Good quality. Only thing is the team names arent attached on the plate itself. It is 2 plastic plates glued to the metal frame. So word of advice. Is to put super glue on edges of team names. And that should hold longer. 	1
10097	Weighted base. I like this tennis trainer because it’s got a bigger base that you’re able to put more weight in. The bottom is also nice and flat so it doesn’t rip over easily. The ball was easy to attach to the string. My kids had a great time with this, getting some practice in. 	1
10098	Cartridges are good, but packing is terrible.. These cartridges are reliable. I’ve been using the, for over 3 years. But the shipping package/box is terrible. There’s no cushioning for anything inside, and the cartridges just bang around in the box. 	1
10099	Hat. It does seem to make it feel cooler 	1
10100	Good bang for your buck. Great product for the price. As accurate as it needs to be for my game. Wouldn’t make a difference if it was off a yard or two. Slope feature makes a huge difference!!! Gotta have steady hands though. The flag was hard to hit sometimes. 	1
10101	Good quality. Good quality. Used for craft project 	1
10102	Very cushiony and supportive. Sizing runs small.. Very pleased overall. I'm glad I tried these on at a local store before ordering on Amazon though. Per the sizing guide, it recommended medium. I have average to small hands but had to order a large. It's still pretty tight around the thumbs when trying to take them off. Very sturdy gloves with Velcro that stays put. Protect hands very well even with aggressive weight lifting. 	1
10103	It’s big (2 in picture). Arrived at the end of July and on delivery time. The mat itself: The Good: -came with a free gym towel -came with straps and sleeve for storage -came with pvc pipe to roll it on -feels good -the price is good The Bad -the only issue i could see is the material probably would not be suitable for dropping weights on. But then again this is a yoga mat. Overall: 4.5/5 	1
10104	Bought for my nephew. He seemed really tickled.. Bought for my nephew. He seemed really tickled. 	1
10105	Good stuff. Very convenient! Has different force. Good for yoga and daily stretch. We also use it for working out and muscle gaining. 	1
10106	Comfortable ankle weights. Adjustable.. Fairly comfortable ankle weights that can be weight adjusted. Good for increasing resistance in light workouts. Useful for back exercises that use legs. 	1
10107	Does job, but feels cheap.. Does it’s job but it just feels cheap in my hands. The seam between both sides of the cases noticeably feel awkward while holding the handle. For the price, it’s a great buy though. 	1
10108	Nice goggles. Nice goggles, clear vision and easy to fit. 	1
10109	Great backpack but overkill on the straps. This backpack looks good and performs well. It’s a great deal especially when you compare it to what backpacks cost now a days. The reason I knocked off a star is because there are just too many straps. There’s more straps on this bag than I can count. I’ll end up cutting and burning these extra straps off because most of them aren’t really necessary and just get in the way of opening and closing the bag. Other than that I’ve made this my new school bag for college. There’s a compartment right in the back of the backpack for my MacBook Pro and all my books fit wel in the pockets provided. The flag also is a great finish to it 	1
10110	Four Stars. Great for working outside! 	1
10111	For the most part I enjoyed my shopping. For the most part I enjoyed my shopping. I would like the item represented more to size,color,shape etc. A written representation would help. Delivery,payment,things like that were very simple and made the experience a good one. Thanks 	1
10112	Looks great on my daughter’s room.. Well made but the screws could’ve been a bit bigger for the plastic anchors. 	1
10113	Great value and quality. I have used this item daily for a month now. I have used up to 160 lb of resistance without a problem. It is very sturdy and a perfect length. The grips are comfortable and don’t slide. I have not had any issues. For the price this is a great value and great quality. I highly recommend this for any home gym with resistance bands. I would have given 5 stars if it didn’t have to be screwed together. A solid bar would have been better. It hasn’t caused me any problems I just tighten it every once in a while. 	1
10114	Nice change. So far so good, fits well, easy to connect! Just hope it holds up, will update review. I switched to leather because the orginal band gave me a rash :( 	1
10115	Four Stars. Was a good replacement for the original Fitbit band the broke. 	1
10116	Four Stars. Works great, holds well but the key gets jammed a lot. 	1
10117	Would buy again. Good holder all around. Only thing I didn't love was the Plastic Clip seems cheap. 	1
10118	My festival friend. I used this while attending a music festival a few months ago. It worked great! No seats? No problem! No standing for hours with this cane! 	1
10119	More support pls. Just wished it was a lil more snug, I got a medium cuz I'm a size 9 1/2 	1
10120	Came fast but looked cheap. It came pretty fast. Much fast then they said it would come. But it did however look very cheap. But the person I gave it to, still liked it! 	1
10121	Works as expected. Bought for my arthritic grandma. She likes it just fine, but I regret not buying the multi-band, multi-handle pack. 	1
10122	Great Value. Great Quality.. I just had surgery on my shoulder AND my foot. This package could not be more perfect. I've been able to increase my range of motion and mobility in my arm because I can do the exercises at home and not just twice a week with the physical therapist. I plan on using these when I get back into the gym too. 	1
10123	Great Quality (not made for wide feet). These are great quality! The only Issue is that my daughter has wide feet so the elastic on top was hurting her a bit. I love these but they didn't work out for her. If your toddler has wide feet I would go a different route.

I think I'll get a couple more of these while I can. 	1
10161	My dog hasnt destroyed it yet. Have had probs with Hockey Balls. My dog loves them - her favorite fetch and chew toy - and they float. That is until she chews them to bits. Tried several, even the "hot weather" versions - and they lasted a few minutes longer than the others. Until these showed up. These have stood the test. My dog is not big but she is stubborn about what she chews. Like they say, its not how big the dog in the fight but how big the fight in the dog. Thumbs up from Daisy and I. 	1
