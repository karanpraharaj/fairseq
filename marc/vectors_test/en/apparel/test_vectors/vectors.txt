threadId=10000	segmentId=10000	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Don’t waste your time!. These are AWFUL. They are see through, the fabric feels like tablecloth, and they fit like children’s clothing. Customer service did seem to be nice though, but I regret missing my return date for these. I wouldn’t even donate them because the quality is so poor. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10001	segmentId=10001	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Belt loops. Belt loops were not fastened upon opening. They were not stitched. !#nexlpEOL#!

threadId=10004	segmentId=10004	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Child hat way too small. The child hat is ridiculously small. It was not even close to the right size for my 3 year old son. I checked the size, and it wouldn't have even fit him as a newborn. I liked the adult hat but it is not sold separately. The seller was rude and unhelpful when I contacted them directly through Amazon. The faux fur pom was either already torn or tore when I was trying on the hat. See the attached photograph. The pom came aprt, exposing the inner fluff. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10005	segmentId=10005	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Wrong size. I ordered this bodysuit in 3-6 months and they sent me a 6-12 months. The label on the plastic bag says a different size of the one in the label on the bodysuit. I don’t know if I should order it again because I am afraid they would send me a completely different size. !#nexlpEOL#!

threadId=10017	segmentId=10017	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Low quality!. This dress is trash! Not even worthy of a house dress. Literally just pieces of material sewn together. Absolutely no workmanship or quality about it! DO NOT BUY!!!! !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10018	segmentId=10018	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Runs smaller than what states in picture. This product is to small to even fit on my waste lining! Made in China so I assume a person that is normal in US large must be a very 3x person over there. But it is what it is! !#nexlpEOL#!

threadId=10021	segmentId=10021	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Softness...not!. I have severe allergies and ordered them because the product info stated they were the softest handkerchief on the market. NOT soft at all...Don’t bother! !#nexlpEOL#!

threadId=10026	segmentId=10026	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Not as it seemed.. When I opened the bag the product smelled of chemical. Which isn't very surprising. Thought I just may have to wash it. I held it up and the fabric was awful. Itchy feeling and very heavy. I tried it on anyway once again I thought after wash this may change. Well it felt heavy on and it has no shape. This is not breathable fabric at all. So I did not wash it repackaged it and sent it back. I bought it to hang around the water park or beach with the kids as a cover up. Nope !#nexlpEOL#!

threadId=10028	segmentId=10028	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Quite possibly the WORST adhesive EVER. The adhesive is not put around the entire edges of the cup, so the pasties folds awkwardly leave your breasts appearing oddly shaped and the cup prone to peeling off.

threadId=10032	segmentId=10032	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Issues with Garment. One of the products I received has a hole in it. It is not a problem necessarily, since I could still wear it under something, but still not very disappointing. !#nexlpEOL#!

threadId=10044	segmentId=10044	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Asian size more fitting for a DOLL not a Human.. Cheap material/fabric. Won't survive one wash. Asian size that will only fit a Doll not a Human. Once again sellers are Amazon listing clothes as American sizes but not referencing that the product is from China or Asian Country. Don;t buy this, you will be wasting your time to mail it back. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10045	segmentId=10045	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Uncomfortable!!!!!. I bought the tie-dyed version and it was SO comfortable. Stretchy breathable material. I decided to buy the black version for work. Bad decision! The material is completely different. It doesn’t stretch, it’s not breathable and it is very small and uncomfortable! It even seems it’s stitched differently so that it coveres 50% less of my head. So disappointing!! !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10046	segmentId=10046	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!I got pink/girls underwear.. I received girls instead of boys that I ordered. I returned and ordered it again, hopefully I get the correct one. !#nexlpEOL#!

threadId=10048	segmentId=10048	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Shipping Nightmare. swimsuit indicated that it was Prime and consistently shipping dates kept getting pushed out to a later time.

threadId=10053	segmentId=10053	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!2 bad lemons in a row :(. I ordered from this company because I've bought it previous seasons and it worked great for us. This season I bought the next size I needed. One of the pajamas I received had a hole on the foot of the pajama. I returned it and the company sent me a new one. The replacement pajama my son wore one time, I put it in my washing machine just like always and the zipper broke off! I'm so disappointed because I don't have time to be dealing with returns every few days and yet that is what is happening right now. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10054	segmentId=10054	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Side panels are see through. These are really more like tights than leggings, especially on the side panels which are completely see through. !#nexlpEOL#!

threadId=10057	segmentId=10057	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!It was the wrong color cant use. It was the wrong color !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10058	segmentId=10058	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Soft, but not good enough quality. Soft... Which is why I haven't thrown it away.. but it doesn't seem durable and the waist line is uncomfortable. I suggest wearing these around the house :) I haven't trusted to wear them outside. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10059	segmentId=10059	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Not for big boobs. The small was entirely too small I’m a 36DD waist 29 hips 40 the boobs did not fit at all so if you’re busty order a size up !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10060	segmentId=10060	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!More like nylons, not tights or pants!. These "tights" are very thin, which I didn't expect given that they were also described as cropped pants. They are too small, although I ordered the large that was specified for my size (I wear a 6 or 8 in U.S. sizes). I can barely get them on, and I am afraid of ripping them. I will probably not wear them; not what I expected at all. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10061	segmentId=10061	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Two Stars. Rinse small. Not colorfast. Color runs even after a few washings. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10062	segmentId=10062	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Two Stars. Nice color but needs to be ironed to wear !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10063	segmentId=10063	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Cheap. Cheap made but not cheap price. Wire in wing took no time to be poking out. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10064	segmentId=10064	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Cheap and broken on arrival.. I am very unhappy with the helmet I received, it came out of the box warped (the shape of the helmet was bent like it had been squished.) The antennae on the side of the helmet had snapped off and will need to be glued back on. There's a really garish emblem on the back of the helmet that's part of the helmet mold so it can't be painted over. I'd say the only saving grace about this helmet is that it's big enough to fit my fat head. Overall you'd be better off buying a helmet off of Etsy. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10065	segmentId=10065	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Order 2 sizes larger for length.. Very short on the sides. Overall, good fit but I do not like to show my belly. Too bad lad got that. Fabric very soft. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10066	segmentId=10066	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Elastic waistband. Do not like the elastic waist at all. Very uncomfortable. Material is thin but soft. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10067	segmentId=10067	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Poor quality. Fit a little more snug than I expected after reading other reviews, but still happy with my purchase. Update: Right after my original review two small holes on the shoulder seam appeared. I wouldn’t buy this again. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10068	segmentId=10068	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Wrong color and size. I received wrong color and wrong size. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10069	segmentId=10069	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Two Stars. Really cute, but the underwire dug into my ribcage. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10070	segmentId=10070	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Two Stars. Too large need to send back for smaller size !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10071	segmentId=10071	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Not true.. These are comfortable but still sweaty they're not what I expected. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10072	segmentId=10072	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Cute hat but for narrow faces. I loved the hat but I have a wider face. The bill didn’t quite look right- was too narrow for my face so I returned it. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10073	segmentId=10073	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!None. I’ll pay extra money to come in early and they come in a month !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10074	segmentId=10074	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!White is see through. This fit well so I can't complain about that. The white is just so see through. Will probably never wear it! !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10075	segmentId=10075	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Two different materials. Flowers look super fake.. This item was way too oversized. The floral print on sleeves is a different material than the black middle of the top. The flowers also look super fake. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10076	segmentId=10076	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Cute but not the best quality. Shirt was cute but quality of material was not great !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10077	segmentId=10077	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!CHEAP looking. I was so disappointed in these shoes. They took so long to be delivered, without and shipping updates whatsoever. When I finally got them I discovered a cheaply made shoe. The platform is either styrofoam or a stacked cardboard like material, and the straps are a very thin and cheap looking felt. The buckle on the ankles do not even properly clasp. I’m giving this product two stars because in pictures and from a distance they do serve the look I am trying to achieve. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10078	segmentId=10078	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!... Expected it to be made out of a material like a bath towel. Too Warm - Expected it to be made out of a material like a bath towel. Very soft, but seems like an old lady would wear this to stay warm inside a building that the A/C is on in the summertime on a 95 degree day... !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10079	segmentId=10079	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!No lift. No support. Just seemed to keep the ladies pushed down and against me. Returning. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10080	segmentId=10080	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Two Stars. Fits kind on tight in the chest area and I'm a 38B and purchase large !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10081	segmentId=10081	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Two Stars. Great style and pattern but Material is cheap and looks it. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10082	segmentId=10082	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Very thin material, the small fit very large, .... Very thin material, the small fit very large, especially in chest. Not sure who this would fit it's just a strange design and material. For reference I am 5'8, 130lbs, 32DD. Provided no support as well and very flimsy !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10083	segmentId=10083	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Too small for Credit cards. Purchased 2 of these for me and my son. It is way too tight to fit credit cards into the slots that they are supposed to fit in. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10084	segmentId=10084	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Two Stars. Bottoms are great, but absolutely no top support !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10085	segmentId=10085	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Not very good quality. I bought the breathable version and it doesn't really do a good job of shaping. After wearing it twice, one of the steel bones started poking out. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10086	segmentId=10086	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!The sizing was way off. Bought size XL for .... The sizing was way off. Bought size XL for my daughter who wears a medium bottom and large top. The size was so small !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10087	segmentId=10087	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Hole in the arm after wearing it twice. Bought the black one with flowers on the sleeves and hood. This is my second time wearing it, and a big hole is forming on my l the left arm from the thread loosening. Returning for poor quality. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10088	segmentId=10088	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Nursing bra. The design is cute but the sleeper bra fits weird. It's tighter under the boobs and loose in the cup area so that when i lay to the side my boob doesn't stay in the bra. Can't wear them to actually sleep in otherwise I'll run the risk of leaking all over my bed. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10089	segmentId=10089	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Disappointed. I’m afraid this body shaper was not for me. Gave me a really weird shape . Not at all comfortable. Will be sending it back. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10090	segmentId=10090	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Way too small even for small toddler. My daughter is very small for her age, she’s 2 and on the 5th percentile. These were small on her and I was honestly looking for underwear that would run small but there have a bikini cut or something so her butt cheeks are out on the sides, she’s a toddler so I dont need that, we needed comfort and coverage since she’s still new to going potty consistently. I gave it two stars, delivery was timely and fine but the product was definitely disappointing. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10091	segmentId=10091	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Awful Packaging. I was very excited to receive this mask for event, only to receive it un wrapped in a cardboard box with scuffs and scratches all over the face mask !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10092	segmentId=10092	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Not my style. The top rolls and the crotch rises up, I didn’t find them comfortable. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10093	segmentId=10093	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!not for workout. If you sweat anywhere at all on your body when you workout, these pants will be look very wet at the slightest touch of moisture. Not for working out. Like baggy sweats that then close circulation just below the knee... !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10094	segmentId=10094	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Didn't like. I sent this back. Waaayyy to big. And the material/quality wasn't good enough for me to spend almost $30. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10095	segmentId=10095	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Pictures pi look different then actual item. On the picture the dress looked like it had flare at the bottom turns out it doesn't. It is just a straight dress that is high in the front and low in the back. Not what I expected !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10096	segmentId=10096	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!I was not given an option to choose a size. they were too large I'm a woman's size 81/2 and I was not given an option to choose a size. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10097	segmentId=10097	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Not as expected. Not sure about every one else but the sticky part to actually lift does not stick quite well. I find myself constantly readjusting. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10098	segmentId=10098	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Poor fit. Wide at the top, tight around the hips. It looks weird and unflattering! !#nexlpEOL#!

threadId=10101	segmentId=10101	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Run big, see through, very long. Do not recommend for the price.. For the price of these leggings I would say they are not good quality. They are very see through. Even if you take your hand and stretch the fabric you can see directly through it. These leggings are extremely long. I am 5'6 and normally need a long inseam and these are much too long for me. They bag and roll behind the knee with the extra material and don't lay right since they are too long. I would also suggest to size down since they run big in my opinion. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10102	segmentId=10102	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Too big in the Waist. The proportions of the pants did not fit my body. The pants were snug in the legs (as desired), but it was way too big in the waist. I am 5'3, 120 lbs and I ordered an xs. I fear the xxs would be too tight in the legs. I am returning this item. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10103	segmentId=10103	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Not for me. I wanted to love this suit!! The pattern is adorable! I ordered an XL (I’m usually a 10-12, between medium and large in pants and tops) so I thought it would be plenty big enough. It barely covered my behind and left me with lots of side boob. After 2 pregnancies my boobs are not what they used to be, but based on where these cups fall you would think they were sagging to my belly button!! The straps in the back cut into me and made it hurt to wear, and if I were to cut them to make it a halter my boobs would be out and about. It just fell so awkwardly on me! The suit I got was the same as the first picture in description. Cute print and nice fabric, but def not for me !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10104	segmentId=10104	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Not worth buying. I weigh 165lbs and typically wear a medium size in top and large at the bottom. The top is way too big and the padding is very odd. It looks unflattering. It would look better on someone who has a bigger chest. However, I did like the bottoms, but they are pretty revealing. Also the color in the picture is way off from the color i actually received. Overall I'm disappointed with this purchase. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10105	segmentId=10105	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Small. Looks good fits a kid too small !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10106	segmentId=10106	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Cheap. You get what you pay for. Clasp always comes undone and change spills out. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10107	segmentId=10107	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Not a fan. Did not work for me. Too big in the midsection, and too short. Not a flattering look at all. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10108	segmentId=10108	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Large hips beware. First of all I'd like to know who got the devilish idea to add pockets to all dresses sold on Amazon. This is a really nightmare! The dress fit, and it's beautiful but because I do have large hips as an hourglass shape, the pockets make me look even larger. This is so disheartening. I hope I'll find a nice dress for my next trip to Jamaica! !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10109	segmentId=10109	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!No shape. Fits like an oversized potato sack.. Not flattering at all. Loved the print and the material was nice and thick. Good quality but the cut of the dress is not good. It doesn't hang all cute like the pic, but more like a think, stiffer flannel. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10110	segmentId=10110	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!NOT LEATHER AS ADVERTISED. The desciption needs to be changed to PU leather, NOT LEATHER! this is wrong!!!! !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10111	segmentId=10111	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Not impressed. The concept of this would be great but the silicone band (for preventing slipping) is not stretchy enough and makes it impossible to get over my hips. And my hips are not that large... I'm not convinced it would be all that comfortable for a petite person either since the fabric is more stretchy than the silicone. I ended up sending this one back. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10112	segmentId=10112	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Fabric color changed after wearing one time! :(. The fit was perfect and I love the light blue color. However, after I wore it one time and hand washed and air dryed the suit, part of the material changed color. It has gray areas all over it. I'm very disappointed. I don't understand why better material wasn't used because it felt great on! !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10113	segmentId=10113	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!good price. after washing. Well made, good price.after washing, dye ran lines diwn front of jeans !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10114	segmentId=10114	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Groovy Papaya not as expected. The groovy papaya colorway has a scripted champion logo stitched on on the picture on Amazon, but what came was a hoodie with just the "c" logo on the top right of the chest !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10115	segmentId=10115	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Bikini and hipster panties are two different things. These are bikini, not hipster. Returned. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10116	segmentId=10116	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Not what I expected. These were smaller than expected and the material wasn't very soft as described. They are also not high-waisted as stated in the description !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10117	segmentId=10117	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Odd fit. It seems to run small yet the arms run so long you have to fold the sleeves if you want to wear it. It doesn’t look good that way. I also had a hard time deciphering the front from the back because neither way for right. I’ll never wear this. I have it two stars versus one because the look of it is exactly what I was hoping for. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10118	segmentId=10118	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!It looks like it was meant for a much older woman. Fits big. I bought this dress (short sleeve). Not flattering at all. It looks like it was meant for a much older woman. It would look great on a senior who doesn’t mind wearing a shorter dress, or maybe to be comfy around the house. I plan to return it. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10119	segmentId=10119	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Came stained. I had been wanting this wallet for a long time. But the ID windows came stained with ink and the plastic is opaque and not clear and see-through, which sort of defeats the purpose of having ID windows. The rest of the wallet looks great, but I'll have to return it because not being able to use the ID windows makes it not functional !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10120	segmentId=10120	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Weird marks on fabric, returned. The fit of this shirt was great and flattering, but the material was so weird! It was loose and clingy at the same time, I don't even know how you do that. It came with tons of white marks on front, back and at the seams, either where the product was folded or stretched, it looked dirty. I have no idea if this will come out in the wash so I returned before finding out. Two stars for fit only. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10121	segmentId=10121	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Lacks quality.. I have had this hat for 2 weeks now and have worn it a few days (4 or 5 days). It is super comfortable, but really lacks quality. The velcro is already separating on the back strap so I'll need to sew it up. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10122	segmentId=10122	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Too small!. Very small!! Too short on my 7 year old. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10123	segmentId=10123	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Too small. This product did not arrive as described. Only tried on the top and it is WAY to small, not consistent with measurements shown. I don’t think I was sent the correct item and there’s not option to return for correct item. Disappointed! !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10124	segmentId=10124	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Skirt fits tight/narrow over plus size shorts. Nice shiny smooth material, long enough, but the skirt fits super tight and slides up. Seriously, for the size they made the shorts underneath, which fit perfect on a 5’8’’ size 18, the skirt is like a super tight pencil skirt, the skirt is more a size 14-16. It might work better if I lose another 10 lbs, but then the shorts might be too baggy. And the inside front has this white secondary panel. I guess it’s for not showing anything on the front? But it’s stupid and super itchy and makes the suit fit all thick and bunchy on the front, and it’s waist band to knees, left outer seam to right outer seam. The back is smooth and silky and comfortable. Not gusseted, so it could crawl up if you get it fit too tight. I’m cutting out the weird white liner to see if that helps anything, and maybe the skirt wont slide up when it’s wet, or I may tack it to the side seam on the shirts. And no drawstring at the waist, which fits well on a small waist/ big booty combo, but might get heavy and pull down in water. Other than that, it’s a good length, hits the top of my kneecap/crease at the back of my knee. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10125	segmentId=10125	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Not good for working in the cold. Didn’t keep my hands warm at work stocking frozen foods !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10126	segmentId=10126	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Two Stars. It's was nice but had a en hole in it up in the front of it. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10127	segmentId=10127	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Size is good. Good condition. Color was not rose gold as per the picture. It is almost write gold. Inside silver is as expected. Size is good. Good condition, good terminations. Disappointed only with the color. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10128	segmentId=10128	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Cheap material. The material was cheap and ripped after a few wears and washes - will not purchase again !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10129	segmentId=10129	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Order a larger size than what you usually wear.. These leggings run small. I would recommend ordering at least 1 size larger than your normal size. They are very well made. An FYI the white legging is transparent. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10130	segmentId=10130	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Nothing. I didn't like it I received the wrong product !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10131	segmentId=10131	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Fun, too small. I love the idea of Jack on my socks, the were way too small. I did give them to my daughter, she wares them. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10132	segmentId=10132	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Great concept but some flaws. I really like the concept of this belt and how it works. As a plus size person I find this belt easy to use and tighten. But I am giving a two star review for two reasons. 1) the buckle is very heavy for its size. Not sure if it’s how it is designed but feels heavy and bulky 2) the class that holds the buckle on slips. I like my belt tight but the teeth just dig in and the “leather” just pulls and stretches. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10133	segmentId=10133	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Mine were defective - read further. Very nice suspenders but mine are defective. One of the clips is missing the nylon teeth insert and does not hold onto pants. This makes them useless. However, if they were not defective, they would have been great suspenders. I will try my luck again likely. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10134	segmentId=10134	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Poor Quality. I wore these bras about 2 times each by the 3rd time the underwire came out. I don't recommend buying these bras. They're a waste of money !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10135	segmentId=10135	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Two Stars. Not anough coverage across the chest. My tits hang out !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10136	segmentId=10136	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Cheap cheap cheap. Cut and material are terrible. I would have returned these but my son saw them and wouldn’t let go :-) !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10137	segmentId=10137	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Runs small!. This runs small,order a size up and it is “ok “,but not comfortable-Plus it has those tiny little snaps and takes a few minutes to get them attached-I wear it because it does work well for me , but I don’t love it-It’s stiff and uncomfortable just dosent have the flexibility I like-I’m sure it would be hot in summer I-Spanx is much more comfortable for every day even though it’s more expensive- !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10138	segmentId=10138	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Thin and Cheap Material. Material is too thin, cheap and itchy. I bought a pair of leggings from Costco and the material was thicker than this jeggings. Definitely going back, too bad was so excited about it. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10139	segmentId=10139	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Very cheap feeling.. The materiel of the bra is very rough. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10140	segmentId=10140	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Not for everyone. Don't like the whole silk nylon feel of this item way too hot for summer and uncomfortable for something that's supposed to clean to you again very small not for thicker women if you have a flat stomach you maybe to pull this off Constable however it is a hot material so I would recommend wearing it at night when you're going out or something is not something that you would think of cloth that you can wear during a summer day and just don't some cute flip flops it's very hot very tight and weird material !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10141	segmentId=10141	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Really big and boxy. Order size down.. I am a size 10 and I ordered a L. It is huge and boxy on me. The sleeves are even too long ( I am 5'7 so its not that I have short arms). Maybe a small would have fit better. I would return it but I didn't try it on when I got it and now it is too late. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10142	segmentId=10142	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Just a simple t-shirt. Nothing spectacular about this product. The color is more lighter than I expected. Feels likes a regular t-shirt. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10143	segmentId=10143	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!low rise, not stretchy. these were too small but my biggest problem is how low rise they are, and have very little give in them !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10144	segmentId=10144	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Great. They work great easy to use !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10145	segmentId=10145	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Disappointed there are no care instructions. Dress fits perfectly. Item is as described. Disappointed there are no care instructions. The dress is extremely wrinkled and I now have to pay to have it professionally cleaned and pressed to remove the wrinkles... all that aside, it is a beautiful dress. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10146	segmentId=10146	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Four Stars. These are very comfortable and I like the variety of colors as I wear many different colored pants. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10147	segmentId=10147	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Love the fit!. Great jacket for a great price. I honestly cannot complain. It keeps me warm though sometimes leaves feathers behind. Overall a great buy! Will buy in another color !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10148	segmentId=10148	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Runs a little large.. I originally ordered the 3x top, but it was a little too big in the bust. Sized down to the 2x and it's almost perfect. A little bit of rolling up, but other than that, super cute top. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10149	segmentId=10149	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Warm. Super warm and stylish hat but runs large on me. Well made and washed well without fading or losing its shape. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10150	segmentId=10150	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Mostly great product. Excellent quality shirts in my opinion but absolutely they run large. I will toast mine in the hot water washer and dry on high to see if they'll shrink down, and report back. The sleeves of the t-shirt are longer than the sleeves on my short-sleeve button down shirt. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10151	segmentId=10151	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Four Stars. Very comfortable. love it !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10152	segmentId=10152	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Very nice.. The color looks very rich and the fabric feels good on the skin. Runs a little snug tho. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10153	segmentId=10153	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Runs small. I ordered medium (typically I am a small) because I read the reviews that it ran small. I wish the tanks were a still little bigger. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10154	segmentId=10154	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Cute. Wish the lenses were a bit darker. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10155	segmentId=10155	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Good quality but runs quite small.. Good quality but runs very small. I’m usually a medium or large, purchase an xl for comfort and it barely fits. The quality of the shirt is nice though. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10156	segmentId=10156	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!liked it now I purchased two more. I had purchased one about a year ago, liked it now I purchased two more. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10157	segmentId=10157	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!beautiful, but not hourglass. Its a beautiful top but I had to return the medium to get a large. the fit was fine except for the hip area. If you have hips, order a size up from your usual, otherwise it won't hang right on you. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10158	segmentId=10158	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Couldn't go wrong on this one!. I liked the price, color, fit, adjustable option & quality of the hat. I did not want a floppy beach hat, nor a dressy looking one & this one is great for everyday use & will go with whatever you're wearing. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10159	segmentId=10159	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Cute blouse but different pattern than pic. Loved the color but the flowers aren’t in the same place as pictured. Didn’t like the huge rose in the front/at mid-chest !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10160	segmentId=10160	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Four Stars. Just okay but fits decently !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10161	segmentId=10161	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Great. Minor inconsistencies but perfect for my use !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10162	segmentId=10162	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Great fit, but a little stiff. Very comfortable, although the material is a little stiffer than I had expected. I marked "fit as expected" but I purposely ordered one size below what I would normally wear. It's a bit snug, but I'm happy. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10163	segmentId=10163	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Alright. Runs small, cute 2 piece. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10164	segmentId=10164	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Finding these was like Goldilocks finding the porridge that was 'just right'. Just what I needed. Finding these was like Goldilocks finding the porridge that was 'just right'. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10165	segmentId=10165	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!beautiful but recommend good garment tape. bought this for a Vegas trip, it was beautiful and fit well, but I didn't quite realize HOW low the v-neck was. Tried using garment tape but couldnt get it to hold--if you have a way to keep it strapped down, then I say give this one a try. I'm sad I didn't get to show it off on my trip !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10166	segmentId=10166	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Awesome dress but it's a bathing suit cover up everything is see through. Love this dress but it's more of a bathing suit cover up because the dress part is completely see-through !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10167	segmentId=10167	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Gave as a gift and the person loved it. Plus they had to wear a full .... Gave as a gift and the person loved it. Plus they had to wear a full leg brace and didn't want to put on socks so this worked perfectly. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10168	segmentId=10168	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Feels great. Feels great, love the high top, I wish I could pull it up better from the back !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10169	segmentId=10169	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!I ordered a small and it actually could have been a bit more fitted.. I love the top so flattering and sexy. My one criticism would be I wish the material was thicker. Because it’s thin I have to wear a strapless bra wish I don’t really need but too revealing otherwise. I wore last night tho and got tons of compliments! !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10170	segmentId=10170	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Love this dress. Love this dress! Wedding, school, it is perfect for any situation with the right accessories! The fabric is a bit sheer when stretched, but its soft and comfy! !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10171	segmentId=10171	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Really nice wallet, good quality.. I love the wallet. Works almost as expected. Cards can not be inserted fully or they get stuck in switching than unable to remove cards easily. Other than that issue the wallet is great. I leave my cards inserted only 3/4 in to prevent issues. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10172	segmentId=10172	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Needs two clasps. I love it. Few things I don't love is it's not as detailed as I thought it would be and the metal is not as strong and bends easily. Also wish there were two clasps on the back instead of just one so it'll stay on my vest without spinning. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10173	segmentId=10173	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!One smaller size please otherwise it’s perfect. The dress is beautiful. The size I order was a little laser for me so go for one smaller size !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10174	segmentId=10174	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Bottom may be too big. Top is very comfortable bottom is too loose. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10175	segmentId=10175	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Four Stars. The material was VERY thin however so I will probably use as Long Johns !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10176	segmentId=10176	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Runs a bit big.. These run big. If you want them to go under jeans or other pants then you need to go down a size. If you're wearing them as pj bottoms or just on their own then get them true to size for a comfy loose fit. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10177	segmentId=10177	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Honest. I have mixed thoughts on this skirt. For 1- I’m usually a small, I’m 5’5 and roughly 120 pounds, but I had to order an XL to fit me (and it’s still a smidge tight) but still wearable. The color seemed brighter to me than displayed in the pictures. I ordered a burgundy and it still is burgundy but looks more red than I would have liked, maybe that’s just personal preference. Also kinda see- through. You can’t see underwear lines or anything but you can clearly see leg imprints right through the dress. It’s jusy an OK skirt to me. Not bad, but not excellent. Great for less dressy occasion- festivals or beaches, etc. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10178	segmentId=10178	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Seems split after an hour of wear. Beautiful but the seems split in the fingers after an hour of wearing at a cocktail party. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10179	segmentId=10179	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Comfy and soft. Really like these. I wear them to bed under nightgown and they are so comfy. Don't pinch or ride up. I gave it 4 stars because the black one is much smaller than the rest so I can't wear them. I will reorder these. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10180	segmentId=10180	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Not for longer torsos. Overall the swimsuit is great- while it fit the body, it was too short for the torso. I am 5’7” and it hardly pulled up my chest. It otherwise fit great but seemed about 2” too short and would’ve had the girls falling out the top! The swimsuit is very high quality, gorgeous print and customer service is great though! I’ll just stick with 2 pieces for my torso length. I have several other Tempt Me suits and they are all perfect! !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10181	segmentId=10181	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Tiny!. Great quality but TINY !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10182	segmentId=10182	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!COZY. pros: -softest fabric ever, wow, so warm!!! -cutest design -fits p well round the body! cons: -short on the legs, even with having it fit a lot lower -buttons spread apart, so it can be a little chilly outside overall, rlly awesome!!!! bought for a costume to hand out candy 4 kids! !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10183	segmentId=10183	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Weirdly out of proportion. Very cool shirt, vibrant colors, but weirdly out of proportion. Too short for a gift to my friend. Returning !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10184	segmentId=10184	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Tie was jacked but great shirt!. I'm 5'3" 170 and the large was perfect! Love this shirt, one of the ties are messed up but I can work through it. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10185	segmentId=10185	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Great gift. Gave as a gift to my friend and she loves them both !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10186	segmentId=10186	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Four Stars. Could have a bigger pocket for my package but they fit well !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10187	segmentId=10187	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!A litt. Are fine, just a bit big for a small thin person who is me. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10188	segmentId=10188	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Four Stars. It was of good quality but pretty thin. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10189	segmentId=10189	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Four Stars. The costume turned out to be better quality than what I expected. The costume was a bit small though. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10190	segmentId=10190	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!I have a little bit of a pooch but it seems to have made it look worse. I'm 5'4 136lbs and 36C. It is worth it for the top! It is really flattering but the highwaisted bottoms just hit at an awkward area for me. I have a little bit of a pooch but it seems to have made it look worse. I'm 5'4 136lbs and 36C. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10191	segmentId=10191	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Nice. A little big but good quality. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10192	segmentId=10192	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Oh boy do these socks look "used" fast!. From a 1 time regular wear, they start looking old & worn. Price wars good, we needed socks, these work for now. PRO: they are comfy !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10193	segmentId=10193	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Good fit. Fit was as expected, however the pants length fell just above the ankle. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10194	segmentId=10194	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Just what i needed. Great shirt fit as expected love the saying. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10195	segmentId=10195	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Just as described. This is a basic puffer coat. If you are seeking a basic coat, then this coat will meet expectations. The coat arrived in a vacuum sealed bag so it needs to be hung up for a few days to let wrinkles come out and to "puff up" a bit. I am 5 ft 6 inches and the coat is knee length on me. I ordered 2+ sizes up due to other comments and past experience, and the coat is probably a bit larger than needed. However, with heavier sweater or sweatshirt, it should be fine. There are no cuffs on the sleeves so I will likely add those later. The hood functions, but no ties on it. The front zipper works. There are no vents in the side or back for added movement, but with the larger size, I should have plenty of room. There are two pockets at my waist (may be higher or lower on you). There are no trims or styling details-- it is a BASIC COAT. For the price, I think it is fine. I did wear it on a windy day, but not cold. I could not feel the wind, so I feel that is a good sign. However, I am curious how it will perform in the colder temps and in the rain/snow (supposed to be resistent). Overall, I am pleased. The vacuum seal bag can be re-used and the seller included a really cute thank you note which was a great touch. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10196	segmentId=10196	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Really works, heavy construction. Even though I returned it I gave it four stars because it worked as advertised. One should be aware that for the garment to do the lifting and shaping that it does, It requires the seams to be very heavy and I found the anal area to be uncomfortable, however I know with time I probably would have become used to it, but I chose instead to try a different product. !#nexlpEOL#!

I have very thin hair, the pony tail has to be so high, to fit through the hole, that what's left of my pony tail is pretty straggly. I'm going to try a top knot next time I wear it !#nexlpEOL#!

threadId=10199	segmentId=10199	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Nicely made though. Was snug for the size. I ordered larger size as well. Nicely made though. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10200	segmentId=10200	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Four Stars. Just what I thought I was buying, no complaints. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10201	segmentId=10201	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Cargo Pants that Look like Dress Slacks. These slacks are the best I have gotten yet from Dickies through Amazon. They fit better than others and they look sharp. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10202	segmentId=10202	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!They look more like a mix of gray and blue not dark anything. The color is not what I would call dark Navy. Or I should say the shirts I received. They look more like a mix of gray and blue not dark anything.. The size is good and they fit. I kept them as the color does not make much of a difference to me.

threadId=10206	segmentId=10206	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Great sleep!. Very soft and not too clingy. Still shows curves nicely though. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10207	segmentId=10207	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Nice. Very nice Dress, thin, need slips under !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10208	segmentId=10208	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Better than my leather wallet. I had items in my leather wallet that I didn't really ever use, so being able to carry the day-to-day items only in my Fidelo wallet is working great. I no longer carry my wallet in my back pants pocket, since the Fidelo is thinner, which gives me greater security from any pickpocket. It fits fine in most of my vest or coat pockets. So far, I'm enjoying it. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10209	segmentId=10209	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Pretty. Decent quality.. These are very cute and the nylon is soft and stretchy. They are not all the same size band though. Some are tighter than others. And several of the bows are on white bands, which I didn't really notice in the picture, but they are still pretty. Unfortunately my baby doesn't like the thicker bands and keeps pulling these off. She doesn't mind the thin nylon bands. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10210	segmentId=10210	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Four Stars. I always order a larger size because it shrinks like crazy. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10211	segmentId=10211	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Women's Two-Piece African Print Halter Ruffle Swimsuit. Though the top was a tad big on me, it wasn't enough to kill the overall vibe and look of the swimsuit. The bottoms fit perfectly - which I expected. So, overall, I was pleased with the purchase. The quality is also very good - which at times with Amazon purchases, can be a hit or a miss. I am a proud customer. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10212	segmentId=10212	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Pinky. The color is closest to the pink that I wanted to match the pink shoes I'd bought. The blouse is nice & fits well enough. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10213	segmentId=10213	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Great for a night out. Worked perfectly. Does the job for a night or evening out. Very well supported. Adhesive/gel loosens after a few hours. The cups did seem a little small !#nexlpEOL#!

threadId=10217	segmentId=10217	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Coat works, but. Other than the buttons/holes are on the female side and it is a bit small for size large, it works. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10218	segmentId=10218	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Not made for us short girls. I love the feel of these pants. They are extremely comfortable and lightweight. I only wish they made them in a petite length. I’m 5’2” and 140 lbs at 6 months pregnant. The length of the pants are probably about 3 inches longer than what I need. I’ll deal with it because they’re so comfortable, but would give 5 stars if they came in petite. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10219	segmentId=10219	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!See More Vividly. Well, Here's the deal...The product arrived on time and in good condition. Very nice packaging makes this perfect for gift wrapping and giving as present. It also come with a nice storage bag and glass case along with a lens cloth. These are plastic lenses...so use the protective cases or they will scratch just like any other plastic lens. These are of the blue blocker variety and they work! Nicely styled with lightweight aluminium alloy frames and comfortable nose pads. I plan to use them for shooting at the range, as well as for night driving. Good bang for the buck...if you protect them. There you have it. !#nexlpEOL#!

threadId=10225	segmentId=10225	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Good for hte price. Not bad for the price !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10226	segmentId=10226	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Decent. The product looks as expected, the only downside is it’s flat. The picture makes it seem that hat had more depth. Meaning it more poking out you have to actually pull out Piece on the hat. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10227	segmentId=10227	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Almost worked, but good quality!. I’m 5’8, 150lbs, 34D, and bought a M. This almost worked! The suit is great quality, but the boob area (the strap connecting the top across the boobs) isn’t quite right for me. If you’re on the fence and don’t mind possible returns, buy it and test it out. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10228	segmentId=10228	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Good suspenders. The best suspenders I've had so far. Sometimes the left side does not hold properly, but in general, they are still the best. !#nexlpEOL#!

threadId=10233	segmentId=10233	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!True to advertisement.. I like these a lot. If I could change anything about the product I would rather the edges to be over edged. Other than that I would order again. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10234	segmentId=10234	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!it works. should come with the glue to hold it in place !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10235	segmentId=10235	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Don’t take seller’s advice. Based on the reviews and the seller’s advice, I sized up to a M when I normally wear an XS/S. Unfortunately, the stitching on the shoulder of the M far surpasses my petite, narrow shoulders, so it sticks waaaay out and makes me look like a football player. When I bunched the material to fit my shoulder, it looked perfect. Therefore, even though this one didn’t work for me, I think it’ll be great when I return it for my true size. Not sure why everyone says to size up, as there is a plenty of extra material... It’s made to be a baggy crop top. Unless you have extra broad shoulders, just order your real size so that it’s a baggy crop top that properly fits and looks good. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10236	segmentId=10236	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!does what they are designed for. These socks have good compression, but I'm not a huge fan of how itchy they are. I understand they need to have the tightness, which cotton can't do, but I really hoped they would be a bit softer. I got them for my varicose veins, especially a problem one on my left leg, which they do what I need them for. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10237	segmentId=10237	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Great tank! I give it 4 stars only because .... Great tank! I give it 4 stars only because there is a logo at the hem so it can only be worn with certain tops or as athleisure wear. Fabric and fit are great. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10238	segmentId=10238	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Perfect. It fits as a true medium !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10239	segmentId=10239	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Colors are off. These are really cute. Fit my 1 year olds head and she will even leave it on for a few minutes!

threadId=10243	segmentId=10243	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Perfect under dresses. I bought these for under dresses and they are perfect for that. I did size up to a large instead of a medium because they run small. They hit the knees on me but that’s because I’m 4’11” !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10244	segmentId=10244	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Five Stars. I absolutely love it. It's TRUE to size. I wear a 12 and purchased a LG. Perfect fit !#nexlpEOL#!

It doesn't wrinkle, even after being crammed into plastic and a box it was very smooth, so that's really cool. This can easily be dressed down or dressed up, and has a kind of vintage feel due to the length and cut, which I'm really into. I think this could be flattering on anyone. I'm 5'5" and 130 pounds and I ordered the small, so I would say if you feel like you're stuck between a small and medium, definitely size down. !#nexlpEOL#!

They always slide off my heel, whether I buy the cheap ones from Walmart or the expensive ones from shoe stores. NOT ANYMORE! I’ve ordered these socks three times because they are the best that I’ve ever worn. I thought that they might lose their elasticity after a few washes but that hasn’t happened so far.

I didn't really have high hopes for this dress as I was expecting more of a costume-like dress, but I pleasantly was surprised! It is really cute and the fabric is thicker than I was expecting which is nice. It is a little tight around the neck and the zipper does not seem to be the strongest, but I got several complements and would highly recommend this dress! !#nexlpEOL#!

threadId=10279	segmentId=10279	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Just what I wanted!. The dress fits perfect! It’s a tad too long but not enough to bother with the hassle of getting it hemmed.

threadId=10296	segmentId=10296	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!I don’t buy wallets but every 15 years but when I do, it’s a Carhartt. Typical Carhartt quality....first rate! What an awesome company! Never owned a Carhartt product that disappointed...and there have been hundreds. My last Carhartt wallet lasted 15 years! What else was I going to buy? !#nexlpEOL#!
