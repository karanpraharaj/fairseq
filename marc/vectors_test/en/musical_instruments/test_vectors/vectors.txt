threadId=10000	segmentId=10000	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Not good for pianos.. Bought for my piano. Tuner would not pick up the top and bottom registers of piano. Also I felt there was too much variance of tuner itself when attempting tuning. Checked it against a tuner app on smart phone and many notes 5 to 10 cents off. Will send back. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10001	segmentId=10001	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Fell apart in shipping- screwed up my gig. REALLY needed this, so ordered two weeks ahead of needing it to take my PA to a friend's house for a party. Well, the packaging came apart and I kept getting notices that delivery was rescheduled. Only after many days was I able to determine that they just returned what's left to Amazon and cancelled the sale. ?? Why they wouldn't dispatch another one is beyond me, so I had to stack amps and EQ's on a table and buy some rubber feet to put between them so they didn't slide around. Real professional looking to have $6K in gear stacked on a table. So, it may be ok if you get one- but chances are you won't, or at least you won't get all of it like SO many reviews state. Just don't bother until Amazon realizes these need to be boxed properly. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10002	segmentId=10002	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!great service. I was impressed by the speed with which it arrived. thank you. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10003	segmentId=10003	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!waste of time. did not work, spit out fog oil ,must have got a bad one !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10004	segmentId=10004	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Stopped working. Stopped working after a couple of weeks. You get what you pay for. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10005	segmentId=10005	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Terrible audio feedback. I bought this little mixer to, well, mix two audio channels to one output and have the option for a convenient headphone port on my desk. When I first hooked everything up, I had serious issues with an audio feedback buzzing constantly. I did some poking around and thought it was the cheap audio cables I purchased. I bought a whole new set of shielded cables to try and correct the problem. It is no longer constant, but frequently pops up when I power it on. You can work around it by replugging in the cables and eventually it will go away. But this is only true while the input 1 and input 2 levels are at the same volume. If you adjust them the feedback gets worse the further they are apart, if you have one at max and one at min - the feedback is so bad it drowns out the audio. I gave it two stars because it technically works, but a simple 2 into 1 audio connection would do the same thing and save you $30. I would not recommend this to anybody and eventually it will go in the trash. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10006	segmentId=10006	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Right ear stopped working after 3 months.. These worked for about 3 months until the right ear stopped working. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10007	segmentId=10007	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Shoddy construction but it gets the job done. A lot of the welds were very sketchy, which made assembly more difficult. I say more difficult because the instructions are unintelligible with pictures that serve almost no function. I still managed to put it together and it holds my guitars, but wobbles too much for my comfort when placing or removing a guitar. Not sure how long it'll last. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10008	segmentId=10008	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Never Got The Packages.. I ordered about 8 items and got only five of them delivered. The other three package was nowhere to be found even though it is shown that it was delivered. I tried to find the items everywhere but there was nothing. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10009	segmentId=10009	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!On stage use. Great sound but the cable that connects to the earphones come undone way to easy. If you’re moving around on stage a lot I wouldn’t recommend it. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10010	segmentId=10010	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Received the wrong product.. Ordered the new style strap locks but received the old style! The old style is still a great product but I didn't order it! !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10011	segmentId=10011	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Bad quality. The product started working well, good sound quality and battery life. After 4 uses, the on off switch started to fail and now does not work at all. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10012	segmentId=10012	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Two Stars. Was given for a Christmas present. Didn't last 3 months and stopped working !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10013	segmentId=10013	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Great Mic/ Poor Base. The mic works great once plugged in with a phantom power supply. The part that you insert the arm into the base came off. Seems like it was only held on by glue. So sadly that seems like poor quality. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10014	segmentId=10014	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Loose seam caused it to rattle. Item mute the sound, but it also changed it (not good). Additionally, the seam between the 2 pieces was loose and rattled anytime I played it. -Down 3 stars- This will be a return item. I think it could be better and for the price I gave 2 stars. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10015	segmentId=10015	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Cool concept! Just needs some more improvements to make it a really awesome product. Really cool concept when it comes to karaoke-ing. I love karaoke so this mic immediately piqued my interests. I think the overall design is good - the rose gold is a nice touch. It's also a standard design that I've been seeing on all other options related to this kind of microphone. For the uninitiated, the way this works is it simultaneously acts as 1) a personal microphone 2) a music streamer / speaker and 3) a voice recorder. Altogether, you have a 3-in-1 device that amplifies your voices and music and records everything that comes out. There's no music in the mic itself though. It has a bluetooth connector so you sync it to your phone and download a karaoke app that can send the karaoke songs to the mic. Or you can even sync your Spotify app. Note that the mic doesn't work with every app unfortunately. The mic comes with different options to adjust the volume level of the music and your voice (separately too!) and even has an option to adjust the level of echo so you actually sound like you're in a karaoke room. Some things I would like to see future improvements on are: 1) there's some annoying feedback that doesn't seem to go away regardless of how far I distance my phone from the mic. If you've figured this out, I'd love to know! 2) the option switches at the middle of the mic is clunky. I'm a sucker for minimalism so it be great if future products can make the design sleeker. 3) support for more karaoke apps Finally, because the sound comes out of this mic directly, and not through a flatscreen or central living room speaker system, it's not as fun in a party setting. If the manufacturer can somehow integrate this into a larger party karaoke ecosystem, that would make this infinity more enjoyable. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10016	segmentId=10016	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Everyday Sound card and Music Recording Equipment. i've had this device for a year and 4 months. it is simple and straight forward to use. i bought this because the drivers are stable, !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10017	segmentId=10017	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Exactly what I wanted. I used these too replace the chrome screws on my Strat's black pick guard. The screws were all well formed, nicely finished, none of them broke, and they look great to me on my guitar. The price was right and I got them in a day or so. !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10018	segmentId=10018	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!As advertised. The low volume is quite good just a little louder than expected but that’s okay !#nexlpEOL#!
threadId=10019	segmentId=10019	!@#NEXLP_DOCVECTOR_SEPARATOR#@!Responsive and excellent service.. The product covered was a wireless mic receiver and transmitter. I covered ith with square trade for three years. After 1 1/2 years of use the product stopped working. I contacted square trade and within 24 hours my claim was duly attended to my satisfaction. !#nexlpEOL#!
