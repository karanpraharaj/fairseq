1006501	Two Stars. Cute, wears well but very thin material. See through as well. Dress ripped after one time wearing it. 	0
1006601	Runs easily. These were cute but run very easily. 	0
1006701	Cheap material.. Nice cut...nice style...skimped on material quality. 	0
1006801	Not as pictured. I always wear a medium so I got a large. The fit was fine but it looked nothing like the picture. The back was not as long as pictured and the “black” was more of a dark gray. It was also extremely see through. I returned it immediately. 	0
1006901	Too bulky. Too bulky to wear under work out clothes. Kinda defeats the purpose. 	0
1007001	Fit weird. The tie knot makes the shirt fit loose. 	0
1007101	2 stars. Run super small. 6 to 9 months can probably fit a newborn 	0
1007201	I would not order this product. I think this bathing suit was made for a size 3 person. I ordered an extra large thinking OK this will fit , no way it did not fit 	0
1007301	Weird fit. Holy cow, this hat is small. And deep! I normally wear kids size hats on my small head and this one was tight. Also, the depth of the hat is weirdly large. If you pull it down even remotely close to having the top near your head, it's down past your eyes. Really weird fit. Sent it back. 	0
1007401	Disappointed. I really wanted to like this hat but the bill is very long and though description says unisex, it is not very flattering on a woman (in my opinion). 	0
1014001	function. dont know about the protection , but a great fitting walet! i like the fact that the compartments are vertical 	1
1014101	Five Stars. Loved the colors. The fit was perfect. Would order again. 	1
1014201	Great buy. Love these. My go to for gym socks. 	1
1014301	Perfect breastfeeding tanks!. I loved these! They fit great and were actually flattering. I did wear a bra underneath them because they don't have any padding, but they had the same type of clasp of my bras so it was easy. 	1
1014401	Perfect. My daughter looks beautiful It’s perfect Am using it as tinker bell dress 	1
1014501	Very satisfied. This is a really nice belt. Good product 	1
1014601	Love!. Love this dress! Fits perfectly and I’ve gotten so many compliments 	1
1014701	Five Stars. They are a little loose, but very comfy. Just what I wanted. 	1
1014801	Comfy socks. These are great no-show socks. They stay on my feet nicely. The fit is right and they are super soft & comfy. 	1
1014901	Nice cheap comfortable hat. I love the flexfit band, and was glad to find these! 	1
1006502	Great looking,Came broken. Hook came broken in half, had to glue back together 	0
1006602	Faulty?. The color never faded or changed like it's supposed to, even when directions are followed closely 	0
1006702	Two Stars. I bought two of these. One broke after the first use. I would not purchase from this company again. 	0
1006802	Don't PayLess Or You'll Buy Twice. Lesson learned because I was honestly expecting a comparable product to similar products on the market. I've purchased 10 other similar shelves and this is by far the lowest quality (lighter gauge metal, weak casters, vertical shelving rows without cross bracing versus the usual horizontal base on the shelves). If you like quality products made with quality materials I would not recommend saving a few bucks. Gave it a star because it could work in a very low performing area like a closet for someone else. So in the end, depends on what you plan on using it for. 	0
1006902	So crooked!!. Love the tapestry but the hem lines are completely irregular. 	0
1007002	Gets hot and makes you sweat!. It makes for a decent topper when it’s cool/cold. However, come spring or summer and this mattress topper makes you sweat uncomfortably. Disappointed because this was my main purpose in purchasing a topper. Having spent a lot of cash, I’m now having to spend more money buying the same product of a different brand! 	0
1007102	... stay on my knuckles unless I bend my hand like the. A couple of them came broken and don’t stay on my knuckles unless I bend my hand like the picture 	0
1007202	I wanted to love this. But it's incredibly light weight and has .... I wanted to love this. But it's incredibly light weight and has some weird lumps in it when I make my bed. Like it doesn't lay correctly out flat. 	0
1007302	Worked well, till it didnt. Worked like a charm till it did. Of the three fans, one stopped working and another spins very slowly. Lasted a good 7months. Expected a window fan to at least be rated for and last a whole year. 	0
1007402	Wrong color match. The pink pillow sham as pictured online is quite different from the orangey-pink color shams i received. 	0
1014002	there are more dirty clothes to see this bag will be happy. Smile laundry bag, there are more dirty clothes to see this bag will be happy. Very good quality! 	1
1014102	Great. Not beginner level. My 10 yr old is loving this. The colors are bright and the pattern is easy to read. 	1
1014202	Used for my crochet projects. Use these for my crochet projects to hold pieces in place while stitching them together 	1
1014302	Perfect sizing. Finally sheets that actually fit the Cal. King and are deep enough for a pillowtop mattress. Getting 4 pillow cases was a huge benefit because when you have a king you always use at least four pillows, a practical and nice looking set of sheets 	1
1014402	Nice quality!. There were no problems with the order. The frames were good quality for the price and the packaging was outstanding. 	1
1014502	Great bedding set.. This bedding set is better then I hoped. In the pictures the pattern on the sheets looks like a gray color. In reality it's a lovely purple like the flowers on the comforter. Nothing shrank when we washed it. It all came out perfect. My daughter loves it. 	1
1014602	I absolutely love this and would definitely buy more. I love the satin sheets, pillow cases and duvet cover. It is very comfortable and I feel like a princess sleeping in my bed. I would definitely buy these again and other colors. I love everything about this Sad but most of all I love the pillowcases because cotton pillowcases snag my hair and damaging the satin ones keep my hair nice and smooth 	1
1014702	Five Stars. Keeps my hair products tidy on my dresser, and prevents them from burning the wood top. 	1
1014802	Have to thank the kids for their gifts.. Beautiful filled with candies for kids as a shower gift. Lol.. 	1
1014902	Fits right over my door, no problem. It's wider & I like that.. Didn't dislike anything, perfect for my needs. The white is so pretty it looks like my wreath is hanging with a pretty ribbon. 	1
1006503	Lower e. Lower e broke the first day.... Come on now 	0
1006603	First time use and they broke. These used to come in a nice case. No longer. First tome use and the stem broke off the ear piece. 	0
1006703	it is ok. never as good as Nespresso. Cheaper yes. Drips very slow, creama is little almost. Bestpresso bad company to deal with, no phone number to call customer service, sent wrong item, no reaction!!! 	0
1006803	Really weak build. It was compatible with my lights but i dropped the controller and never worked again. 	0
1006903	Update: Nicely encased and performs well.. Update: One of the two is now turning to dust. It has been sitting in the violin case and only taken out to use it on the bow. The second piece seems to be holding together, This is Rosin is nice and wide for very easy use with the bow. It comes with a very nice lid. 	0
1007003	Excellent sound, atrocious build quality.. These headphones sound absolutely amazing. Better than anything I've ever heard. Supposedly, they are the best closed back headphones you can get at this price range. And I am inclined to believe that. They come with a leather (possibly real) carrying bag, a comically long straight cord, and an annoyingly sized spiral cord. The spiral cord went down to my knees with my music player in my pocket, making it not ideal for commuting. I purchased a much shorter cord for my commute for around $10. Very impressed overall. However, these broke on me after 3 and a half months of use. I took them off and SNAP, a piece of the hinge on my left side snapped, leaving wires exposed and the headphones unwearable (they still work). Throughout my ownership of these cans, whenever I moved the ear cups, there was a cracking sound, like the plastic was screaming for help. I thought that this was just an odd feature, but I now believe it to be a design or manufacturing flaw. I am unsure if Audio Technica and/or Amazon would cover this under a warranty or not. I do not have the budget to pay them to fix it, buy new headphones, or waste money shipping the headphones back and forth to possibly get a free repair done. So, I will probably have to do a crappy epoxy or tape job to fix these, as I absolutely cannot stand to listen to dollar store ear buds anymore. I bought these headphones not only because of the sound, but because I was led to believe that these were extremely durable headphones that would last me years to come. That is perfect, because I used these on my daily commute, brought them camping, took them halfway across the US with me, and I used them for practicing my instruments. But alas, they did not last, so I cannot recommend these headphones with their current build quality, unless you are to only use them at your desk. And at that point, you might as well buy more expensive, better sounding headphones (not that these sound bad, because they don't). I am impressed, but at the same time thoroughly disappointed in this product. I cannot recommend these to your average consumer. Consume at your own risk. 	0
1007103	Mediocre. This thing crapped out on me after just a couple uses. Now I use an app in my phone. 	0
1007203	:(. not happy with how quite these speakers are.... max out volume on my computer and the sound is dull... o well. 	0
1007303	Two Stars. Love the pedal fast shipping! Patch cable not included. 	0
1007403	poor battery life. After just a few hours of use over several days, I noticed the transmitter channel display blinking saying the battery is low and then abruptly shuts down. I'll be sending these back and maybe going for the Xvive. 	0
1014003	Good & worth the money. The price is very reasonable, my son and I really like playing this keyboard, we have lots fun of it. The quality is very good, too. 	1
1014103	Highly recommended. Bought this for my 2 year old whose obsessed with music and singing!! He loves it! It gets pretty loud but has very good sound to it! Bluetooth connection works perfect! Would highly recommend ! 	1
1014203	Great cable for what was needed!. Cable assembly well constructed. needed to feed a camera for facebook streaming with a single audio output channel. Connectors were solid and made good connection. No wiggling to make good contact needed. Well done! 	1
1014303	Son loved it. Great purchase for my 5 year old 	1
1014403	Perfect mic cords. When I saw these colored mic cords in a set of 6 different colors I knew they would be an excellent addition to my stage setups. Previously I used colored electrical tape but this makes the identification of which cord goes where immediate. Beyond that the quality of the sound and the fit of the plugs is superb. Excellent choice going with the 25’ length too. Great for almost every show. 	1
1014503	Great small mic. Easy to use mic for phone/pc/laptop. Great if you just need a small mic and don’t want to spend a lot of money. Works well. Comes with velvet carrying bag. *disclaimer: I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review* 	1
1014603	Product works and it is a competitive price.. Worked as advertised. Not much else to comment on. 	1
1014703	Best speaker for the money. Great item little speaker that pack a punch. Really good sound quality, easy to connect to Bluetooth and has the aux cord option also, Micro SD slot so you can add your own music. Charging is simple red light need a charge no light fully charged. Well worth the money. You will not be disappointed with this purchase. Comes with a clip, USB charging cord, aux cord. 	1
1014803	It hasnt dropped a hi hat yet!!!!!!!!!!. Does what its supposed to do!!! 	1
1014903	Sounds great. Good build quality, good sound quality. The actual sound quality is perfect, you could spend well over the price of this microphone for the same quality. Would recommend to anyone! 	1
1006504	Three Stars. Inaccurate information about the straps. My mom suffered with the straps they don't give her what she needs. I go and try to help my mom and in the end I lost money. I was so mad that I threw it away after receiving it because of accuracy information. 	0
1006604	Doesn't keep hair dry. Now I would give it only 1 star as it really does Not keep my hair dry, and I am very unhappy with it 	0
1006704	They are selling used products as new!!!. I don’t know if what I received was someone else is return or what, but I am disappointed they did not even make the effort to remove the chalk from the rope or the wooden circles. The package was open already and had clear signs of use. I have yet to try them, first impression is that they look sturdy and durable. 	0
1006804	Terrible delivery service! Fire them!. The package was left on a small brick wall facing a busy street instead of by the front door where it would not be seen or stolen. 	0
1006904	Will rip fletching. At first I really liked this rest until holes started appearing in my fletchings. I realized that the round metal piece that holds the wire has a sharp edge that will rip the fletch on the arrow. I will try filing it down but now I have multiple arrows to repair, so I would recommend spending a little more to get a better rest. 	0
1007004	not a good impression for a brand new purchase. Just purchased and upon air up, one of the balls has a hole... not a good impression for a brand new purchase. The red ball has no hole, but the blue one just cant handle the pressure. 	0
1007104	( don’t waste your money. Gun worked for a little over 30 days, just past the return window :( don’t waste your money. Used it for 4 days during that month. Bummer. 	0
1007204	Pressure tape is garbage but light is Bright, Bright, Bright!!. Update: Had to return this light. Pressure switch wires broke on install. Recieved another one, same thing. I'm not even bothering with returning this one. Just going to solder it better than the factory. Unfortunately it's a piece of crap. The flash light and the mount and charger seem to be fine but, the pressure tape is flippin garbage. First review:Very bright! Looks to be well made. It's a good deal for sure. 2 rechargeable batteries and a charger! Wow. 	0
1007304	Wet suit!?!. Fit sorta baggy around the knees, the fabric is exactly like a wet suit, so good luck running in it. I returned it. Waaaaay to thick to actually exercise in, and doesn't fit snug enough to wear as wet suit shorts. GO NAME BRAND 	0
1007404	not happy. They lasted 2 times the 3 time the put It broke into pieces so i had to buy a new one at the pool that cost me twice as this one 	0
1014004	Product as described.. Product as described. Fast shipping. 	1
1014104	Holds All You Will Need!. This backpack will hold it all! Ruger 9mm, Taurus Judge, S&W Shield 9mm, Glock 40 and S&W 38 revolver. Held all the ammo I needed for a one hour session at the range. Padded all around, plenty of pockets for mags, loaders, whatever. Just had it a little over a week and it seems like will hold up well! 	1

1014604	Great for carrying my iPhone while I walk.. Great for walking. A little on the small side but my iPhone XR fits snug and it works. Great magnets. 	1
1014704	Great workout bag for gym. Great bag! Fiancé loves it for using at the gym for lifting gear. Small and compact to carry around easily in gym 	1
1014804	Totally worth it. The quality is good and very sturdy so it can shape the body well.Totally worth it 	1
