200008	Picture Doesn‚Äôt Represent Well. There is a terribly done band across the top. Supposed to keep the shirt on your shoulders but seems more of like a waistband. 	0
200010	Not what I ordered. I am disappointed in this purchase. I bought one of these in another color and in size XL and it fit great. This one I bought in white in XL and it fits like a Medium. I cannot wear this top and am really disappointed about that, It is advertised as XL but seriously this top would only fit someone who would be a size s/m. An XXL would have been a better choice for me because the sizing is incorrect on this product. 	0
200019	Way too large. Buy one size smaller, they r BIG 	0
200027	Width. Wrong size for my husband. I need to return them, unfortunately. 	0
200046	knee highs. My mom loves the mild compression of the knee high but says the top is too loose and falls down. She cannot wear them. I was after a looser top because the others cut into her leg and stop circulation. Any suggestions? 	0
200134	Where do I start.... First of all, the color is definitely baby pink, not the taupe-ish dusty rose color that is pictured. Second, I would never consider this a wrap dress, I would say it‚Äôs a glorified kimono. Third, it‚Äôs completely see through and fourth, the boob area was way too baggy so unless you‚Äôre EXTRA blessed in the chest department this might just look like a saggy cheap robe. In spite of the high hopes I had for this ‚Äúdress‚Äù, I‚Äôd have to say it‚Äôs a big thumbs down for me unfortunately. 	0
200149	Awful. Looks cheap. He didnt care of course. He liked it. But I prefer to wear things that look and feel of quality. It also runs large. Overall, waste of $$ 	0
200166	Cheap, Easy Tear. Very cheap material, ripped almost instantly when wearing and putting hands in pocket. Would not recommend. 	0
200169	this item did not arrive on time. When I .... this item did not arrive on time. When I requested return, no immediate response. Once I receive the return label, the words on the label are very small. Overall the customer service is poor 	0
200180	Skip this one. Poorly made. Looks really cut in the picture but the padding is weird and the poor excuse for underwire was already coming out when I opened the box. You get what you pay for with this one. 	0
200197	Way too big. I ordered a size down since I like the bands to feel snug and secure, but it was wayyyy too big. I cant even wear them because they slide down or roll up. Its unfortunate because I was so excited to order them! The material on the band also is not sticky enough to adhere to the pants. Wish I would've returned when I had the chance. 	0
200201	I bought the dress in a size medium, but .... I bought the dress in a size medium, but it was way too big. The waist needed to be taken in a few inches. If it was smaller in the waist area, I think it would have had a more flattering appearance. 	0
200216	Don‚Äôt waste your time. I will be sending this item back. I bought the 2XL after reading reviews and the cups on the top are smaller than a training bra and I can‚Äôt get the top to clasps at all. I‚Äôm a 36 C and there is absolutely no way this would fit. 	0
200219	Sizes aren‚Äôt accurate.. Newborn size is far too big to be a newborn size. I ordered size newborn but when it arrived the tag says 0-3 mo, and it‚Äôs much bigger than my other 0-3 month clothes, it‚Äôs closer to a 3-6 month onesie. 	0
200221	Never received.. Never got the product. They offered a full refund for it. 	0
200226	Fabric. Fabric was pure polyester, not good for infants. I wouldn't have bought it if I had known. 	0
200250	One Star. To short, material is hard. 	0
200270	Bad quality product. Fits too small and the material breaks easily 	0
200271	Difficult to get in and out of it. Too .... Difficult to get in and out of it. Too many handles and the zipper ids way smaller than the purse. 	0
200279	Very cute but doesn‚Äôt stay on!. All of the belts are very cute but once you start moving around while wearing them they come open and fall off. The links on the black belt completely fell off the belt. :( 	0
200334	Don't buy it from these guys. Do not buy this item from this company. The item came without the proper cuts in the wristband, and when I actually tried to fix it the material just turned to crap. One star is too high but had to mark it with one 	0
200348	Unfortunately. If you have bigger boobs all it‚Äôs going to do is give your boobs creepy wrinkly looking mess 	0
200359	Order one size larger than you think you are. It‚Äôs very short - not nearly as long as pictured. Does not fit as it should - improper sizing on vendor‚Äôs part. 	0
200389	Not impressed. They just fit awkward and looked weird 	0
200414	Returned. Not as described at all. Poor quality. 	0
240004	disappointed. Sent it back. Was disappointed. Did not like material and collar was weird and so was fit of belt and bust was lower than i expected. 	0
240013	Cute, but too little. Order a two sizes up. I ordered a medium and I normally wear a small.. 	0
240020	Sadly disappointed. I was very excited when I first got them! Then I held them up to the light and realized I could see through them completely. Then when I went to try them on, there was no stretch. If I stood completely still, they fit perfect, but I could walk in them without them moving down my hips. 	0
240027	???. I've had this USB drive for about four months. I reformatted it to use for different data, and it only gave me 56 GB. Formatting again didn't help. Disappointed. 	0
240059	NOT leather !. it is NOT leather, it's just plastic and has a weird smell too ! I was easily able to scratch off the "leather" off of it with my fingernail ! 	0
240063	Pass. Way too tight around the hips and too long around your lady bits 	0
240082	Loose around waist and neck. Also hole. There‚Äôs a hole in the sleeve and the turtle neck was awkwardly loose 	0
240092	Confusing sizing.. The size chart is way off. Not sure if anyone is monitoring the 'Size Chart' link vs. the sizes offered for selection. I selected an XXL because the size chart says an XL is a US size 8. I needed a US size 10 or 12. Well, the shirt is exactly what you would expect a typical XXL might be. It's very confusing as I've ordered some of these Chinese made shirts before. Sizing is all over the map -- sometimes they follow the size chart and sometimes they are the actual letter size. Makes it very difficult to guess which one it might be. Wanted a few new tops for my niece and of the 6 Chinese-made tops I ordered, only one fit. It's a waste of time to wait for them and then to have to send them back due to this type of error. 	0
240097	Two Stars. Fits pretty small and the fabric is not the quality I expected. 	0
240100	They‚Äôre comfortable as far as thongs go- I prefer g strings .... I‚Äôm not into thongs thought I‚Äôd give these a shot. They‚Äôre comfortable as far as thongs go- I prefer g strings wanted to try thongs. Front pouch coverage deceiving cuz the only photo with a model allegedly wearing one shows a much narrower front pouch- I like minimal coverage I wouldn‚Äôt have bought these if I saw there was so much fabric in front. That being said, I like the waistband sides are like string bikini and tail is comfortable would‚Äôve gave it 5 stars if front was narrow like the 1 photo of model allegedly wearing it 	0
240103	Runs small. This was very cheaply made. Very thin material, not at all as cozy as my other carrier hoodie. Big gap around where baby‚Äôs head comes out so it‚Äôs not very warm. 	0
240109	Was Great but broke too easily. Broke....had to return it....but it was a funny shirt 	0
240113	The quality is great but if for some reason you shake it the .... The quality is great but if for some reason you shake it the cards drop... Hope you improve it. 	0
240143	Good fit. More buttons which add shine to the jacket than I thought. In the picture the jacket looks clean but in reality...too many brings (something which I personally don't like) 	0
240161	Poor quality, way too small.. I bought this hoping it would be more like the Wrangler Riggs work jacket. Sadly, it was of significantly poorer quality, had only buttons rather than a zipper front, the hood fabric was very thin, and the size (I ordered a 2x) was way too small, more like a Large, with very short sleeves. I returned the jacket. 	0
240167	I did not receive all my socks. I dislike the fact I have only received 5 pair of socks vice the 7 I paid for with this transaction. 	0
240186	Meh. I want to love this shirt I really do... When I first got it had a very strong odor to it. So I decided to wash it before using it on my son for his 2nd birthday party. After washing it there were several cracks in the truck where green fabric show through. I'm still going to use it because it's only for one day however for the $15 I paid I expected it to make it at least a few washes... Oh well it's still cute and the truck made my guy happy 	0
240201	Color fades quickly. The trunks are fine when new. However, within 4 months of normal use (I swim 2-3 times a week at a pool), my black trunks have faded into a strange green color. 	0
240214	Careful washing!!. I really like this sweatshirt. It fits well and is very soft. I‚Äôve had it for a few months and always wash and try it on normal cycles with no problems. Until I accidentally wash and dried it inside out. The lettering fused together and rips when I try to separate it. So after a few wears it‚Äôs completely ruined. üòî I‚Äôm so bummed. 	0
240215	I hope it was a mistake because the fabric it self was good and it fit great. I send it back, the ped was stiched in the worng place. I hope it was a mistake because the fabric it self was good and it fit great. 	0
240219	Thin material. The material isn‚Äôt that good it still shows off every dent nook and cranny even if you wear another dress over it. 	0
240221	so it's hard to wear them like you're supposed to without messing up your hair. These are very soft and cute but they're kind of tight and the bridge does not extend enough, so it's hard to wear them like you're supposed to without messing up your hair, but if you have a small head these would be perfect! 	0
240235	Runs small. Took a long time to get it and it runs too small 	0
240237	I‚Äôm plus size and this fit bad. Bug in the top because I‚Äôm short and .... It was cute, I‚Äôm plus size and this fit bad. Bug in the top because I‚Äôm short and tight and unflattering. 	0
240250	Runs big, really big. I purchased this in a small and it's massive. Even after washing and drying it trying to shrink it it's still too big. I gave it to my friend who normally wears size medium and it was even too big for him. The quality seems fine otherwise. It smelled strongly of chemicals when removed from the package. 	0
320005	Four Stars. super cute and adjustable. now to see if they will hold up and work well in montana. 	1
320012	Price and quality. Good set for the price 	1
320020	Great tote purse. This looks just as pictured, very cute design and very spacious. The only problem I had was the straps kept coming off but once I tightened them they‚Äôre good to go! 	1
320027	As described but the delivery took so much longer. The product seems good fabric, but the delivery took so much longer. It didn't fit me well, was too large. But I'll use it to sleep, so it's not that problem. 	1
320037	Comfortable leggings. Very nice, soft leggings in exactly the color I wanted...only 4 stars ‚Äòcause even though the fabric is not see through, it‚Äôs fairly thin and only good for layering in very cold weather. 	1
320039	Read the description!!!!!!. It's soft and very comfortable. I didn't read the description well enough to see there is glitter on the shirt and it's a printed graphic not actual lace. 	1
320040	Four Stars. it was fairly comfortable. worth purchase .... 	1
320041	Fits well. It fits well for post partum belly 	1
320056	belts. The belts are actually a brilliant idea. Not a 5 because the buckle is not as nice as others I've seen. 	1
320064	Adorable, but runs a little small...get the next size up.. So cute! Bought a large as a gift for my mother-in-law, and she loved it. Only problem: I ordered a large and it looks like a medium. Hopefully it fits her and doesn't shrink. 	1
320071	fits good. looks good with my jeans. very satisfied 	1
320077	Good purchase. My only complaint is that you can‚Äôt .... Good purchase. My only complaint is that you can‚Äôt adjust the collar stay very easily as I thought. It takes some time getting used to but all in all good purchase. I like how the item can fit all the collar stay sizes. 	1
320091	Four Stars. Nice pants but, way to be big!! 	1
320116	Very comfortable and nice looking. I really liked the look of these denim looking blue jean leggings. They are very comfortable too. The only suggestion is put a little tummy control at the top. Even without the tummy control of other leggings I have, I ordered a pair of these leggings in black and they are just as nice. 	1
320121	Nice summer suit. I love this bathing suit! Only issue is that the bottoms are somewhat sheer out of the water, but otherwise I like this! 	1
320137	Love the shirt. Love the shirt! My only complaint is that I wish the arms were a bit longer. I should mention that have very long arms and this is my usual complaint. 	1
320144	Ok I'm feeling these!. Just got my joggers, style is great and fit. I can work out in them and style around in them as wearing them as casual wear. As someone who works out comfort and style is a must, not to mention a good price point. I just found my perfect athletic wear from top to bottom. I plan on getting the matching jacket next. I highly recommend their wears to any guy (thumbs up!). 	1
320152	HOT HOT HOT (Literally). Super cute dress! I absolutely loved it, fit as it should. My only complaint is the material, it's a fuzzy spandex body suit, it's a hot box! If you're body temperature is higher in your pregnancy, purchase at your own risk. I'm not generally a warm person and I sweat through this dress in an hour. 	1
320158	Best socks if you stand for long hours. I purchased them for my husband because he was complaining of heel pain when exercises and want not too tight socks around the ankle. They came earlier than what they state. They are made of nice material that make soft compression on on your heels and not too tight. They mentioned it should be hand wash but I washed them many many time in gentle cycle and yep they still doing the same work. I just wish if they could make it with other different colors to match out fit. I made another purchase but for me this time. I like to wear them when I work at home as well at the park when I go to play with my kids 	1
320161	What I ordered. Fits as expected, but rides up sometimes which is annoying. Fabric quality as expected. 	1
320201	Cute suit!. Cute suit! Love the ruffle and when it goes up while swimming you still have coverage from the high waisted bottom. Ordered a second one in a different color combo 	1
320203	Four Stars. these are really soft and comfortable but I think they run a little big 	1
320225	Very nice. Husband loves them they are very nice and sturdy 	1
320235	Cute but not a lot of support. This is a cute swimsuit, but the top offers deceptively little coverage and tends to slip down when I'm moving around. Luckily, you can tighten the straps, so that does help a bit with that problem. Still, I would not recommend this swimsuit for anything who wears larger than a C cup. 	1
320238	Love it. Absolutely love this set!! Super pretty without being overdone, only wish the bra straps were adjustable! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5‚Äù and 130 lbs for reference 	1
360000	Love them! Bought every color.. Love it! Truth be told, I find regular bras annoying to wear so practically live in sports bras. These caught my eye as providing my cleavage a bit of a boost as well as having a more...attractive look than your typical sports bra. Would I wear it on a jog? No, I really don't think it would provide me comfortable support. But for everyday wear and light activity? Absolutely no complaints. Matter of fact, after buying the black as a test run, I ended up buying every color. 	1
360019	Protects from the sun and looks sexy!. Awesome. Easy to get in and out of. Well constructed with durable fabric. 	1
360027	AMAZING. LOVE THESE!!! they fit so well and my ginormous 5 month old will be able to wear them for a bit longer!!!! seriously the best purchase 	1
360034	Five Stars. This top is adorable 	1
360046	Standard T-shirt. Fits as expected. No complaints. üòä 	1
360080	Living legend since 1958 T Shirt. I bought this for my husband‚Äôs 60th birthday he put on on for his birthday party and again two days later. He loved it. It did well when it was washed. 	1
360099	Great for big sunglasses. I need something to hold my new prescription glasses - I wanted to protect my Coach glasses and this was perfect. Double protection and great to toss in beach bag 	1
360138	It runs a bit small, but is still okay.. I like the softness and length. It is also light but not too thin. 	1
360150	Super comfortable and cute. I have a hard time with off shoulder shirts sometimes, it seems like they want to ride up onto my shoulders. This shirt didn‚Äôt do that at all, it stayed exactly where it should be. I even danced in it. I love the sleeve accents and the lace, the shirt makes me feel very pretty. I adore it. 	1
360192	Feeling sexy. Love it can be used for any special occasion or just want to feel sexy 	1
360211	Worth it!!!. The fabric material of this shirt is soft and flowy and the color doesnt fade when washed but the size does run small and its snug from the chest area so i would suggest ordering 1 size larger than what you usually wear. I personally really liked the ribbon tie that came with it... You can style it in different ways as you can see in the pictures attached. 	1
360226	Five Stars. Very warm and fit great 	1
360227	You won‚Äôt be disappointed! Very cute.. Good quality, you won‚Äôt be disappointed! 	1
360263	Good but they sent me a dirty one. I love these bras- BUT i received a black one with white deodorant marks on the pits! So that was a little startling! Sent it back and re ordered another. I hope i don't get the deodorant one again! 	1
360300	Socks Stay Put!. I really like these socks and have purchased several sets over the past few months. While I ordered the ones pictured, I did not receive the colors I thought I had ordered (as noted by other buyers). That is ok and I will not deduct a point for that, as it is not the seller that I am rating. The socks stay put, are comfortable, and look absolutely adorable with boots. Great product. 	1
360345	Five Stars. Great product. Arrived quickly, works as advertised. 	1
360360	To reshape your body this is the product to do it. This is my second time ordering this product I am 55 168 pounds I purchased a large it when I got to that their role I purchased a medium and it is what it looks like. I‚Äôm sorry I couldn‚Äôt get the video but here‚Äôs a picture of me in a large 	1
360364	Great socks!. Love these socks! I'm still wearing them after labor and delivery. 	1
360396	Love!. I wore this throughout the winter. SO comfy! Fits perfect! 	1
360398	Best shorts everrrrrr!. I got these in white. I just hiked in them. I‚Äôm 8 months pregnant and they form fit right to me without being too tight on the baby which is very important! I can also tell that they will easily fit me when I‚Äôm not pregnant. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7, 170 lbs. normally am 145-150 when not pregnant. The white isn‚Äôt see through at all. Material is thick. And so so comfy! I WILL order this in other colors and maybe double up on the white pair! 	1
360411	Great buy. The price and quality very good 	1
360432	fantastic belt, if you prefer a leather belt that's .... fantastic belt, if you prefer a leather belt that's firm this is not for you. this soft feel is very smooth and comfortable. 	1
360438	Nice!. Nice coin purse and just the right size! 	1
360444	Just Right for Elementary School Student. I bought this for a huge WWE fan. He loved it and showed it off to his big sister. 	1
360467	Great. Great product I swear a lot and this helps on special occasions when I wear a suit. Only dislike is the deep deep v neck 	1
