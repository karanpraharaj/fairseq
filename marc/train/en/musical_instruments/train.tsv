200572	Disappointed in the lights. Bought two of these lights and they seemed to work when tested. I mean they turned on and responded to sound as was expected. During an event ( first use) these lights had problems and did not respond to the remote and the buttons in the back. Also could not get the lights to work with the DMX and could not be slaved. Fussed with the light trying everything possible but had no success. Very disappointed as I was very excited for these lights. Luckily we had bought and brought other par lights from other brands that we used with no issues. 	0
200844	Does that sound or feel like a guitar. I did not like the fact that it doesn't resemble the feel of a real guitar. I thought I was going to be to be able to practice playing on the go, but this was not the case. If you're looking for a practice tool to help you learn where to put your fingers I guess this would work. If you're looking for anything more than that this is not what you're looking for 	0
200938	One Star. Not a great buy for my 3 year old. Volume wouldn't stay low no matter what we tried 	0
201055	Random, loud static-even if I turn down volume.. Randomly super loud static sounds. Thought it was my cable and bought a new one-but no, its the amp. I have to turn it off all the time, then turn it back on to get the attic to go away. Just missed the return window. I'm stuck with it. 	0
201262	Don't waste your money. Absolute piece of junk. Display is so dim you can't read it, but that's not too important since it doesn't work at all to begin with. I finally got the metronome feature to work, but that's not what I bought this for. Waste of money. 	0
201286	Poor. the divits in the stick are so shallow they barely make any sound. Poor product 	0
201429	Goes off and on and is hard to use. I used this on an acoustic guitar and the day I got it it was hard to set it up so it would tune. It keep going light and then dark thought the battery was bad so changed it and problem was the same. Never did get to tune my guitar right . I would not recommend this tuner there are better ones available . 	0
201595	Not even close. NOT a G note. Tuner reads it vacillating between E and B and doesn’t even sound good at those notes. One star was generous. 	0
201871	Empty Envelope Delivered. For the second time I received an Amazon envelope unsealed and empty. I would like a replacement sent to me. I can send a photo of the empty envelope if that would help. 	0
201969	One Star. This is a toy at best. There is no sound variation, it all sounds the same. 	0
202258	Buy brand name. First time I used them at a school dance and one blew out after 1.5 hours of use. Spend the xtra money and buy brand name. 	0
202583	DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. I BOUGHT 2. I'M RETURNING 2. LESSON LEARNED.. OK UPDATED REVIEW NECK RATTLES I ASSUME FROM CRAPPY CHINA MADE DEAD FRETS UNFORTUNATLY I ALREADY INVESTED A TON OF TIME ON THE FOLLOWING; CLEAR COATS PRO FRET JOB, LEVELED SHAPED AND POLISHED. CHANGED OUT THE NUT DRILLED AND ADDED TUNERS WHICH WON'T FIT WITHOUT RE-DRILLING! SHAPED HEAL EO FIT POCKET WHICH IT WON'T WITHOUT WORK. 	0
202914	Bought two of these for xmas for my kids. .... Bought two of these for xmas for my kids. The microphones stopped working on both 3 days after they opened. No response from customer support. 	0
203109	Accurate description, accurate pictures.. Terrible, looks more black when the album is on the slip mat. Look close at the pictures, its a see through kind of color. Gross misrepresentation of the actual color. Nothing like what their showing, buyer beware. Now, i found the real deal on ebay, what you see, is what you get, but the price is twice as much but worth the correct color. The ebay labeled picture is what im buying and am returning these, mine as well just buy the black serato vinyl from amazon, those will be the correct color. 	0
203445	One Star. Cord were not strong enough. Students pull them apart within a month 	0
203765	Photo did not match the product received. Not what was expected 	0
203843	In ear monitor. Returned this product. Lack of clear directions. Complicated to use. 	0
203928	Faulty product. I was excited when I received the item. So I put the stickers without carefully inspecting it first. It was just after an hour that I noticed It has a relatively big crack on the side and on the back. Very disappointing. 	0
204457	Arrived in an unsealed box, clearly pre-owned. Delivery - what a disappointment. Delayed my setup. I purchased a new shockmount and what arrived was clearly pre-owned. Box was not even sealed. No opinion on the return process at this time. 	0
204496	Not useful for clarinet players. Very thick and cumbersome. Not useful for clarinet players. 	0
204527	Either they send the cables or I'll buy cables and continue to give the bad rating. I'll consider returning the unit and purchas. Just received the product and the two patch cables are missing. I honestly can't rate the product since I'm not able to use it without the patch cables. Either they send the cables or I'll buy cables and continue to give the bad rating. I'll consider returning the unit and purchase a Vox unit Guitar Center. 	0
204701	do not buy them. the worst ear protectors if you're a dj do not buy them 	0
204771	Micro fractures two days in. I received this two days ago. I was very excited to start to learn how to play, but today I heard a strange click a couple of times... I looked closer and small fractures are popping up... I don't know why but I'm very sad. I got the hard plastic so I could take it everywhere and not worry much about it breaking... But I haven't taken it anywhere and it's breaking anyway 	0
204847	Nope. Window on top of finger cover made this unuseable. 	0
204953	No Manual. As one reviewer noted, this is a solidly built unit. Beyond that, however, its functions seem to be very limited, at within Cubase. It mostly just duplicates everything that my number pad already did. The fader won't write automation, which is the main reason you would want a physical fader in Cubase or any other DAW. It may have hidden functions that I haven't yet discovered (I hope), but I have no way of determining what those functions might be because it doesn't come with a manual. I mean seriously, NO MANUAL. 	0
240056	The stand is pretty sturdy, I don't like the plastic top everything .... It arrived in a beat up box with holes in it. One nut and bolt was missing ( had to a trip to the hardware store ) . The stand is pretty sturdy , I don't like the plastic top everything slides off it . I wanted to use it to hold a mixer , maybe . 	0
240096	Not life like. Many of the flower petals were falling off as I opened the package. Not that life like. I don't think they'll hold up outside in the wind. If you have an indoor planter where people can't get close, ok. 	0
240338	Returned to Amazon. One of the lavalier wireless microphones did not work, and the other that was working dropped out constantly. And as a result the product was returned to Amazon. 	0
240433	Ok. I’ll give two stars because they aren’t toys. It’s nice to find the key but they sound bad. A lot of bad holes and feels flimsy. I’m comparing to Marine Bands so for a beginner or just a hobby player these would probably be great. But not really for a show or recording. 	0
240486	A small amp that does not work. I got this amp a few months ago and loved it for about a month. The audio keeps going in and out. I am moving now and have decided to just trash it. Terrible amp. Get a better quality amp for more money. 	0
240664	Good thing it's a 3 pack one string broke as .... Good thing it's a 3 pack one string broke as I was putting it on and another broke after a few minutes of playing. 	0
241075	Its ok. The stand is nice but the charging is so slow. 	0
241250	Chair can not be assembled. The chair came with a construction issue, so you can see inthe picture the room for the 2 back legs is not the same therefore one leg has to much room and can not be fixed and the other one does not fit at all. 	0
241269	Toy Violin. Purchased this for my son as he is rough on violins. Took it to get it tuned and the bridge put on just to find out the bridge didn't have spaces for the strings to go and that the violin is a toy not a true violin. I was told that by the time I spent the money to make the violin playable I would have spent more than the $250 the store was charging for one of theirs. 	0
241303	At least one one works. One works well the other keeps cutting off 	0
241390	Lasts about a year or so. After some time (1 year plus) it dies after about 20 mins 	0
241741	Two Stars. Light works but it doesn’t rotate at all so I gave it 2 stars 	0
242017	Put your money elsewhere.... This think looks and feels nice out of the box. But the clamp needs to be more heavy duty. The bottom part where the tightening crank is bends way too easily as you tighten it. 	0
242230	I have requested a return credit from Square Trade several .... I have requested a return credit from Square Trade several times for a product that I returned. Still no reponse!!! 	0
242273	Flimsy and won't last long. It's a basic stand, a bit shaky especially if you put some sheet music book on it. I could probably live with it, but angle adjusting knob broke after six month (folded/unfolded it once a week), had to buy another brand. 	0
242455	Creates loud buzz on pedals with shared power. It is L O U D. I've got this thing sharing power with some other pedals to save plug space (which is kinda the point) and whenever the LED light is on I get a huge buzz in the other pedals. Considering the $60 price tag that's a big disappointment. 	0
242735	Need ASAP. I didn’t get my package yet but according your side package has been delivered. 	0
242803	Running in line from a PC results in a LOT .... Running in line from a PC results in a LOT of buzz on the output. Trying to get around this, but so far this is really irritating. 	0
243263	Not ready for prime time yet.. Product feels very unfinished compared to other blocks. It lacks its own charging port and had a terrible time keeping it connected to my MacBook. It is pretty much useless with Logic Pro X unless you spend way too much time setting it up. Can’t understand why the Blocks Dashboard application doesn’t have presets for popular DAWs you can load on demand. 	0
243475	Doest fit. Its too small for the Rode Mic Pro. Nearly broke it trying to fit it on. 	0
243832	Save your money. They look just like photo. The sound quality isn't that great and they fall out of my ears. They fell out of my ears and hit the floor and broke open. I was able to put it back together, but this just shows the overall quality isn't that great. I charge them all day long and they die after 2 hours of play. It's just inconvenient and I'm disappointed. 	0
243882	Pretty, but not durable. Pretty case, but didn’t last long. Clips that held it together broke quickly. Wasn’t terribly upset, because you get what you pay for 	0
244374	Not suitable for acoustic guitar - cigar box only. If installing on an acoustic guitar where you must follow the curve of the body, you'll be forced to install the box upside down, which may be a bit frustrating for the player. But even worse than that - the pickup is 1/8th inch thick. This means you either must route the saddle groove that much deeper, or sand 1/8th evenly off the saddle bottom or "enjoy" your action (string height) 1/8th inch higher! 	0
244727	2 stars because it does play, kinda.. I ignored the other reviews for this product in favor of its lower price. That was a mistake. In order to hear anything from the speakers, we have to have the volume high enough to make the speakers hum. Returning to purchase a higher quality item. 	0
245010	Waste of money. Cuts out when using. Can’t stay on for an entire 30 minutes. Sounds good for maybe 15 minutes before it goes out and you have to mess with it to get it going again. 	0
320097	A bit chunky but good to use, good for beginners. I do recommend this for beginners but if you play at a more advanced level I recommend you goto a professional instrument shop to get a better mute. Oh well, you get what you paid for. 	1
320145	makes good sound. works better than the mic that came with my karaoke machine. makes good sound. 	1
320195	Good, but small.. Smaller than I expected but looks to be okay quality for the price. I would not put a lot of pressure on the peg remover as it doesn't appear to be very strong. A good value though. 	1
320228	Recommend. Nice beginner guitar for the price. 	1
320290	satisfied. I love its construction and looks. was expecting a little more clean low end though. 	1
320475	Four Stars. Great product, wished price was lower 	1
320579	So far so good. Bought for my 8 yr old son, so far he’s loving it! Learning to play in the schools Uke Troop 	1
320610	Good not great. Quality is lacking. But great price. You will have to wait quite a while to receive it. Overall a good value. 	1
320747	I have use the light in different situations. It’s .... I have use the light in different situations. It’s worked out well each time. For the light to be so small. It’s very strong. Having the remote is a plus. My plan is to get another one 	1
320752	Compact size and number of options given the size is good. I like the size, that it clips on a belt or waistband. I wish that the volume control I set would remain fixed after I turned it off and turn it back on again. Unfortunately once you turn it off the volume level used it does not stick. When you turn it back on the volume is always at high 	1
320790	noise maker. not enough noise maker 	1
320914	Can't beat the price. Great price. Screw holes slightly off but unnoticeable once it's on. It did come scratched so that may bother you. I figured it'll get scratched when playing anyway lol. Again you can't beat the price. 	1
321211	works for Yeti mic if you don't mind tightening a screw a little bit.. I was reading some reviews on whether or not this works with Blue Yeti mic, and even the description says it doesn't, but I got it anyway because my friends who own this say it's fine. I wasn't expecting much when I made my purchase, but turns out it's actually not that bad; the arm is lightweight but it gets sturdy after you mount it. I did have to tighten the screw at the top with a small wrench to hold the Yeti in position (right now I have it up diagonally). I haven't noticed any drooping but it's only been couple days and I've been moving it around, but overall I'm satisfied with this arm for the Yeti mic! 	1
321298	Well worth the price. Probably not up to the professional quality of Stewmac luthier tools, but meet my DIY needs just fine. 	1
321562	Four Stars. Great keyboard works as listed. Quick shipping. . 	1
321665	Great sticks, but I modified them a bit. The stick is smooth and kinda slick, and the tip seems to be sanded and glows way more than the stick, so I sanded the whole stick the same way, and they seem to work better. 	1
321759	Good Microphone. Decent quality for what you pay, have since passed it on to a friend and is still working after the years. 	1
321763	Gorgeous. It is perfect. Shipping was on time. No issues with it at all. 	1
321800	Four Stars. mic works just fine , 	1
322049	Four Stars. Son likes it first time player. 	1
322090	Like a longer 2B. Good pair of sticks, it's like a longer 2B 	1
322558	So far so good !. The material is smooth when touching it ! looks sturdy and beautiful ! The quality is decent . I Hope that clamp was a little bit better designed just to match the mount or something.. idk but overall it's a good item and i'm happy with it. 	1
322583	Good product. So far so good. My kids are enjoying this singing machine. Seems easy to use. 	1
322886	yup. works.. Works perfect. Honestly slightly tighter than even I prefer. But it's solid and it makes the keys stay in place. Not going anywhere. Most people think I'm carrying around a flute or something LOL. 	1
323212	Durable. Bag is durable and well padded. It's also big enough for most of my hardware. Some hardware may be too big for the bag without completely disassembling it. It can also get difficult to carry if there's too much in it, or if the sizes of the contents allow the bag to bend. If I upgrade, I will probably go with a longer bag/case with at least one hard side and with wheels. 	1
360104	Buy this one. Works great, good purchase to protect instruments 	1
360274	and it's perfect for her. My niece loves it! This is her first year in band in middle school, and it's perfect for her. 	1
360379	Five Stars. Lots of comfort when playing my 10.25 pound bass for long practices and shows. 	1
360430	Satisfactory. I am learning bass guitar and I have the standard Squier by Fender model guitar. I wasnt expecting much from this stand but its compact and seems sturdy and holds the guitar fine. It stays in one room for now, its perfect if you need a stand to hold the instrument inbetween practice sessions. 	1
360620	awesome. sounds great. nice addition to my drum percussion 	1
360709	Does The Job. The Vic Firth stick holder is very well made. It's not going to fall apart any time soon. it also fit my drum rack. The only downside is its capacity is two pair of sticks, if you consider that a downside. overall, this is a well constructed stick holder that will last you a long time. 	1
360780	Five Stars. As a beginner in playing the violin, this is what I needed. 	1
360821	Good. Good very good! I like it very much! 	1
360824	Perfect!. Been through a few and this is the best one yet. Feels like high quality but I fear to drop it. 	1
360862	Nice guitar. Its a nice guitar, light yet big enough 	1
360943	Worth the extra cash. Sound amazing! Seem to last longer due to the nano coating. 	1
361066	Great cable. Very well made, nice clean look, very light weight,great price, got here fast 	1
361398	Great lights. Bought for a grands kareoke party and they worked perfectly for what we needed. Very bright and 2 was plenty 	1
361476	Good quality product. Good quality product 	1
361565	Fun lights. My husband makes a Halloween trail every year and we are always looking for something new to make it more exciting for the little kids! These lights light up the trees in the ground and make it look really small gam my husband makes a Halloween trail every year and we are always looking for something new to make it more exciting for the little kids! These lights light up the trees in the ground and make it look really Spooky! 	1
361567	Easy to apply; works well. It was very easy to put on the wall as it came with the screws and dry wall anchors, and works well for my ukulele. The materials do feel a bit cheap, but it holds up well. 	1
361606	3rd Tuner!. Such a great little tuner! I really love the fact that you can tune based on capo positioning. Such a tight fit on the head :) 	1
361658	Light and portable.. My son loved it for his keyboard. 	1
361671	Great audio quality for the price!. Great audio quality for the price! 	1
361786	Excellent Uke stand!. This is an awesome uke stand! I teach public school and have to keep mine separate from the rest of the class, this holds it perfectly and it’s very sturdy. Don’t hesitate to purchase! 	1
361833	Less likely to drop my pick!. These are great, and my Fender picks fit right inside. 	1
362001	Perfect. Great quality and size. Perfect 	1
362215	Sturdy stand , easy to put together. Easy to put together, sturdy , works well for my keyboard 	1
362460	Perfect.. As advertised. Quick shipping. Great product. Great seller. 	1
362579	The built-in straw nozzle changes everything!. For years, I've wished that DeOxit had a built-in straw - my wish has come true! This makes this product flawless. Use it on anything electrical that's being disagreeable - bad switches, corroded wiring points, scratchy volume pots. You name it! 	1
