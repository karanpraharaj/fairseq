I'm guessing I would have ripped it immediately had I not been careful putting it on. The mouth is terribly small as well and doesn't feel like it's in the proper position. The only good thing about this mask is the material - It's pretty hefty and seems like it would keep me warm, but I can't outlook the issue with the eyes and mouth. It would be so simple to slightly widen the strip between the eyes, and maybe use less fabric on the sides of the mouth.

However it won't stay in a QD socket at all, the smallest amount of force will cause it to pop out of the socket, which is very dangerous. Had it pop out of the QD socket twice at the range and nearly dropped my rifle both times but luckily caught it. Only buy these if your going to put it on a cheap rifle that you're not afraid to have potentially dropped, which kind of goes against the whole reason of having a sling in the first place. If you are looking for QD swivels for a duty rifle or any gun you'd depend on with your life then look elsewhere, these will fail when you least expect them to.

However, the toys are very small and fall over easily, especially when you wind the base to play the music. I also feel they could easily be lost, so I glued the pieces down to make them permanent and will put fun treats; i.e., Hershey kisses, miniature peanut butter cups, etc. in the compartments. The compartments are small, each holding about 2 Hershey kisses, so if you want to put gift cards or larger candies in them, it will not work. Not all fun size candy bars will fit."}

It only has one button, and if it is set correctly I have no trouble accessing the button (to end or answer a call). 2) Battery seems to last a long time... put it this way...I have not had the battery die on me yet after numerous calls during a day. 3) The charging method is clever. . . just plug in the USB base, and the earbud has a magnet that grabs it out of your hand for a perfect connection every time. You can find in it dark easily! 4) The speaker is very clear and un-distorted....I'd say the best I've ever had. 5) It has a seemingly long range... longer than others I've had. DISLIKES: 1) I do not like the voice. Why not use the old AT&T woman's voice? This woman speaks the commands clearly, but I just don't like it. Sounds like an old girlfriend. 2) When you walk too far from your phone, it doesn't warn you. . . it just disconnects. You have to turn it back on to reconnect. 3) If you don't use it for awhile, it will turn itself off. I guess that is a good thing? I just have never turned them off until I'm done for the day. 4) Occasionally, and always when you are trying to connect a call..... it will just not work correctly. The phone may show you are connected, but the device is not connected and NOT working. I guess it could be my phone.....I am just not sure.

If it gives me too much trouble, I rub it with a dryer sheet and it helps counter the cling (and smells great, ha!). That said I do have a pet peeve for clothes I have to make adjustments to wear (ie rubbing down with a dryer sheet), so its not as grab and go I as would like it to be."}

{"id": "3529", "label": "1", "text": "Almost a match made in heaven I Really like it, but it’s not quite a love story; it’s very powerful, for something so small, and lightweight. However, the combination of how/where the hose exits the canister, and the size and number of wheels on the bottom, lead to a continual nuisance of tipping over. The plastic lever for switching out attachments is very cheap plastic, and broke as I was unpacking the vacuum. This may be a huge issue for some, but I don’t ever use attachments, so for me, no harm, no foul. The location of the power switch is a bit problematic as well, considering the other switch located in the mirror position on the back of the canister, causes the cord to retract. I’ve done this no less than 500 times. And no, for clarity, I am not a slow learner. That said, I do in fact, love that the vacuum has a retractable cord. I realize it is trivial, but for me, the winding and wrapping of a loose cord is just irritating. Not difficult, irritating. So the fact I don’t have to wind and wrap and wind and wrap, I’ll give it a star back, for the convenience it provides. Overall though, the pros far outweigh the cons."}

{"id": "3539", "label": "1", "text": "Works great for shaving soap I got tired of my favorite shaving soap being out of stock and decided to make my own. I originally tried the clear soap like this from the same manufacturer and added my own raw shea butter, but it came out to waxy. The amount of shea butter in this is perfect. I add in tea tree oil and melt it in the microwave in my shave soap container. Works as well as the name brand stuff I use to buy, but at a fraction of the price. Just make sure you have a good badger hair brush to use with this. If you don't have a shaving soap container, you can use a small tupperware container with a lid. I use a Proraso shaving soap container from a previous purchase. It's all plastic and works great."}

I would suggest this specific product over others due to its sturdiness and ease of assembly.
